    abstract = { Additive models (AMs) have sparked a lot of interest in machine learning recently, allowing the incorporation of interpretable structures into a wide range of model classes. Many commonly used approaches to fit a wide variety of potentially complex additive models build on the idea of boosting additive models. While boosted additive models (BAMs) work well in practice, certain theoretical aspects are still poorly understood, including general convergence behavior and what optimization problem is being solved when accounting for the implicit regularizing nature of boosting. In this work, we study the solution paths of BAMs and establish connections with other approaches for certain classes of problems. Along these lines, we derive novel convergence results for BAMs, which yield crucial insights into the inner workings of the method. While our results generally provide reassuring theoretical evidence for the practical use of BAMs, they also uncover some "pathologies" of boosting for certain additive model classes concerning their convergence behavior that require caution in practice. We empirically validate our theoretical findings through several numerical experiments. }

    abstract = { Science and technology have a growing need for effective mechanisms that ensure reliable, controlled performance from black-box machine learning algorithms. These performance guarantees should ideally hold conditionally on the input---that is the performance guarantees should hold, at least approximately, no matter what the input. However, beyond stylized discrete groupings such as ethnicity and gender, the right notion of conditioning can be difficult to define. For example, in problems such as image segmentation, we want the uncertainty to reflect the intrinsic difficulty of the test sample, but this may be difficult to capture via a conditioning event. Building on the recent work of Gibbs et al.\ [2023], we propose a methodology for achieving approximate conditional control of statistical risks---the expected value of loss functions---by adapting to the difficulty of test samples. Our framework goes beyond traditional conditional risk 
    control based on user-provided conditioning events to the algorithmic, data-driven determination of appropriate function classes for conditioning. We apply this framework to various regression and segmentation tasks, enabling finer-grained control over model performance and demonstrating that by continuously monitoring and adjusting these parameters, we can achieve superior precision compared to conventional risk-control methods. }

We therefore propose \emph{cost-aware SBI methods} which can significantly reduce the cost of existing sampling-based SBI methods, such as neural SBI and approximate Bayesian computation. This is achieved through a combination of rejection and self-normalised importance sampling, which significantly reduces the number of expensive simulations needed. Our approach is studied extensively on models from epidemiology to telecommunications engineering, where we obtain significant reductions in the overall cost of inference. }

Many recent approaches rely on complexity or uncertainty concepts to impose constraints on probability distributions, aiming to identify specific classes of directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. In this paper, we introduce a novel identifiability criterion for DAGs that places constraints on the conditional variances of additive noise models. We demonstrate that this criterion extends and generalizes existing identifiability criteria in the literature that employ (conditional) variances as measures of uncertainty in (conditional) distributions. For linear structural equation models, we present a new algorithm that leverages the concept of weak majorization applied to the diagonal elements of the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix to learn a topological ordering of variables. Through extensive simulations and the analysis of bank connectivity data, we provide evidence of the effectiveness of our approach in successfully recovering DAGs.

First, we provide a simple understanding of the online learning approach through its connection to online convex optimization of \emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. As a byproduct, we present an offline guarantee on the \emph{suboptimality loss}, which measures how well predicted objective vectors explain the agent's choices, without assuming the optimality of the agent's choices. Second, assuming that there is a gap between optimal and suboptimal objective values in the agent's decision problems, we obtain an upper bound independent of the time horizon $T$ on the sum of suboptimality and \emph{estimate losses}, where the latter measures the quality of solutions recommended by predicted objective vectors. Interestingly, our gap-dependent analysis achieves a faster rate than the standard $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound by exploiting structures specific to inverse linear optimization, even though neither the loss functions nor their domains possess desirable properties, such as strong convexity. }

Then we propose HistOfTree, an estimator that fully leverages the information contained in both public and private features. Theoretically, HistOfTree reaches the mini-max optimal convergence rate. Empirically, HistOfTree achieves superior performance on both synthetic and real data. We also explore scenarios where users have the flexibility to select features for protection manually. In such cases, we propose an estimator and a data-driven parameter tuning strategy, leading to analogous theoretical and empirical results. }

In this paper, we consider non-stationary scenarios, which are crucial for certain applications but are currently less well-understood.  Specifically, we provide the first algorithm-independent lower bounds, where the time variations are subject satisfying a total variation budget according to some function norm.  Under $\ell_{\infty}$-norm variations, our bounds are found to be close to an existing upper bound (Hong et al., 2023).  Under RKHS norm variations, the upper and lower bounds are still reasonably close but with more of a gap, raising the interesting open question of whether non-minor improvements in the upper bound are possible. }

We also examine the numerical stability of two distinct refinement strategies: iterative refinement and recursive refinement, which progressively improve the accuracy of a sketched linear solver. Building on this insight, we propose a novel algorithm, Sketched Iterative and Recursive Refinement (SIRR), which combines both refinement methods. 
    SIRR demonstrates a four order of magnitude improvement in backward error compared to iterative sketching, achieved simply by reorganizing the computational order, ensuring that the computed solution exactly solves a modified least-squares system where the coefficient matrix deviates only slightly from the original matrix.
    To the best of our knowledge, SIRR is the first asymptotically fast, single-stage randomized least-squares solver that achieves both forward and backward stability. }

    abstract = { We introduce copula-based neural networks (COPNN), a novel framework that extends beyond the limitations of Gaussian marginals for random effects in mixed models. COPNN integrates the flexibility of Gaussian copulas in capturing rich dependence structures with arbitrary marginal distributions, with the expressive power of deep neural networks (DNN), allowing it to model large non-Gaussian data in both regression and classification settings, while using batch learning and stochastic gradient descent. Unlike traditional linear and non-linear mixed models, which assume Gaussianity for random effects, COPNN leverages copulas to decouple the marginal distribution from the dependence structure, caused by spatial, temporal and high-cardinality categorical features. This is achieved by minimizing a batch negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss in the continuous case, and a batch negative pairwise log-likelihood in the binary case. We demonstrate COPNN's effectiveness through extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets. COPNN reduces NLL and MSE in the regression setting, and improves predictive accuracy in the classification setting, compared to previous state of the art methods which integrate random effects into DNN. Our real-world experiments, conducted on datasets from automotive pricing and retail traffic forecasting, further validate COPNN's ability to improve performance over traditional methods for dealing with high-cardinality categorical features. }

To address this, we propose Cluster Synthetic Control (ClusterSC), based on the idea that groups of individuals may exist where behavior aligns internally but diverges between groups. ClusterSC incorporates a clustering step to select only the relevant donors for the target. We provide theoretical guarantees on the improvements induced by ClusterSC, supported by empirical demonstrations on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results indicate that ClusterSC consistently outperforms classical SC approaches. }

In the high-privacy regime ($\epsilon\le 1$), we identify an optimal privacy mechanism that minimizes the variance of the estimator asymptotically. Our main technical contribution is the maximization of the Fisher-Information of the sanitized data with respect to the local privacy mechanism $Q$. We find that the exact solution $Q_{\theta,\epsilon}$ of this maximization is the sign mechanism that applies randomized response to the sign of $X_i-\theta$, where $X_1,\dots, X_n$ are the confidential iid original samples. However, since this optimal local mechanism depends on the unknown mean $\theta$, we employ a two-stage LDP parameter estimation procedure which requires splitting agents into two groups. The first $n_1$ observations are used to consistently but not necessarily efficiently estimate the parameter $\theta$ by $\tilde{\theta_{n_1}}$. Then this estimate is updated by applying the sign mechanism with $\tilde{\theta}_{n_1}$ instead of $\theta$ to the remaining $n-n_1$ observations, to obtain an LDP and efficient estimator of the unknown mean. }

Compared to classical two-sample tests, which focus on comparing precise distributions, the proposed framework provides a broader and more versatile set of hypotheses. This approach enables the direct integration of epistemic uncertainty, effectively addressing the challenges arising from partial ignorance in hypothesis testing. By generalising two-sample test to compare credal sets, our framework enables reasoning for equality, inclusion, intersection, and mutual exclusivity, each offering unique insights into the modeller's epistemic beliefs. As the first work on nonparametric hypothesis testing for comparing credal sets, we focus on finitely generated credal sets derived from i.i.d. samples from multiple distributions---referred to as \emph{credal samples}.
    We formalise these tests as two-sample tests with nuisance parameters and introduce the first permutation-based solution for this class of problems, significantly improving upon existing methods. Our approach properly incorporates the modeller's epistemic uncertainty into hypothesis testing, leading to more robust and credible conclusions, with kernel-based implementations for real-world applications. }

We analyze sDM in OPE and OPL, highlighting the benefits of leveraging action correlations. Empirical evidence showcases the strong performance of sDM. }

    Bayesian neural networks are a promising approach for modeling uncertainties in deep neural networks. Unfortunately, generating samples from the posterior distribution of neural networks is a major challenge. One significant advance in that direction would be the incorporation of adaptive step sizes, similar to modern neural network optimizers, into Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling algorithms without significantly increasing computational demand.
    Over the past years, several papers have introduced sampling algorithms with corresponding theorems stating that they achieve this property. 
    In this paper, we demonstrate that these methods can have a substantial bias in the distribution they sample, even in the limit of vanishing step sizes and at full batch size. 
    Furthermore, for most of the algorithms, we show that convergence to the correct distribution can be restored with a simple fix at the cost of increasing computational demand. }

However, while fine-tuned models have been shown to significantly improve predictive performance compared to models trained from scratch, they can exhibit poor calibration and fail to reliably identify challenging distribution shifts. In this paper, we improve uncertainty quantification in fine-tuned models by constructing a data-driven uncertainty-aware fine-tuning prior that assigns high probability density to parameters that induce predictive functions with high uncertainty on input points that are meaningfully different from the data. We derive a tractable variational objective to perform approximate inference in models with data-driven uncertainty-aware priors and evaluate models fine-tuned with such priors on different transfer learning tasks. We show that fine-tuning with uncertainty-aware priors significantly improves calibration, selective prediction, and semantic shift detection on computer vision and natural language classification tasks. }

This issue is particularly pronounced in non-IID settings, common in clinical contexts, where variations in data distribution, class imbalance, and training sample sizes result in client heterogeneity. To address this issue, we propose a mode connectivity-based FL framework that ensures the global model resides within the overlapping low-loss regions of all clients in the parameter space. This framework models the low-loss regions as non-linear mode connections between the current global and local models, and optimises to identify an intersection among these mode connections to define the new global model. This approach enhances training stability and convergence, yielding better and more equitable performance compared to standard FL frameworks like federated averaging. Empirical evaluations across multiple healthcare datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework. }

The added complexity of enforcing \emph{sparsity}, or shorter explanations, complicates the problem further. Existing methods often focus on specific models and plausibility measures, relying on convex $\ell_1$ regularizers to enforce sparsity. In this paper, we tackle the canonical formulation using the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method, a simple yet efficient first-order procedure capable of handling smooth non-convex objectives and non-smooth $\ell_p$ (where $0 \leq p < 1$) regularizers. This enables our approach to seamlessly incorporate various classifiers and plausibility measures while producing sparser solutions. Our algorithm only requires differentiable data-manifold regularizers and supports box constraints for bounded feature ranges, ensuring the generated counterfactuals remain \emph{actionable}. Finally, experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively produces sparse, manifold-aligned counterfactual explanations while maintaining proximity to the factual data and computational efficiency. }

Recent work has developed theoretical insights into these algorithms by studying a continuous-time ODE model in the case of a fixed policy (BYOL-$\Pi$); this assumption is at odds with practical implementations, which explicitly condition their predictions on future actions. In this work, we take a step towards bridging the gap between theory and practice by analyzing an action-conditional self-predictive objective (BYOL-AC) using the ODE framework. Interestingly, we uncover that BYOL-$\Pi$ and BYOL-AC are related through the lens of variance. We unify the study of these objectives through two complementary lenses; a model-based perspective, where each objective is related to low-rank approximation of certain dynamics, and a model-free perspective, which relates the objectives to modified value, Q-value, and Advantage functions. This mismatch with the true value functions leads to the empirical observation (in both linear and deep RL experiments) that BYOL-$\Pi$ and BYOL-AC are either very similar in performance across many tasks or task-dependent. }

We present a novel Sort and Snap estimator, which uses the empirical proportions to sort the alphabet, and then snaps them to the associated term from the Zipfian distribution.  For arbitrary decay rates and smaller alphabet sizes, as well as for large decay rates and large alphabet sizes, we show an exact or minor variant of this estimator is near minimax optimal and has exponential improvement over the standard empirical proportion estimator. However, for small decay rates and larger alphabet sizes a simulation study indicates the standard empirical proportion estimator is competitive with Sort and Snap procedures. In addition to providing nearly tight bounds for important high-dimensional estimation problems, we believe the Sort and Snap estimator, and its analysis, will have independent interest. }

State-of-the-art algorithms for this problem use gradient-based Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions which only yield useful search directions for $\beta =1$. Therefore, constraints with $\beta \geq 2$ have been ignored in the literature, and their empirical performance remains unknown. We introduce $\beta$-th Order Taylor Series Expansion Based Local Search ($\beta$-LS) which yields actionable descent directions for any $\beta \in \mathbb{N}$. Our empirical experiments show that $2$-LS obtains solutions of  higher quality than $1$-LS, $3$-LS and $4$-LS. $2$-LSopt, an optimized version of $2$-LS, obtains high quality solutions significantly faster than the state of the art which uses $\beta=1$. Moreover, $2$-LSopt does not need any graph-size specific hyperparameter tuning. We prove that $\beta$-LSopt is guaranteed to converge to a Coordinate-Wise Local Stationary Point (Cst) for any $\beta \in \mathbb{N}$. If the objective function is convex, $\beta$-LSopt converges to a local minimum. }

Bayesian inference for these models has been extensively studied and applied in tasks such as time series prediction. However, the use of standard GPs with basic kernels like squared exponential  kernels has been common in GP-ODE research, limiting the model's ability to represent complex scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce normalizing flows to reparameterize the ODE vector field, resulting in a data-driven prior distribution, thereby increasing flexibility and expressive power. We develop a variational inference algorithm that utilizes analytically tractable probability density functions of normalizing flows. Additionally, we also apply normalizing flows to the posterior inference of GP-ODEs to resolve the issue of strong mean-field assumptions. By applying normalizing flows in these ways, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for Bayesian GP-ODEs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated dynamical systems and real-world human motion data, including time series prediction and missing data recovery tasks. }

Therefore, density ratio estimation from finite samples is a very important task, but it is known to be unstable when the distributions are distant from each other. One approach to address this problem is density ratio estimation using incremental mixtures of the two distributions. We geometrically reinterpret existing methods for density ratio estimation based on incremental mixtures. We show that these methods can be regarded as iterating on the Riemannian manifold along a particular curve between the two probability distributions. Making use of the geometry of the manifold, we propose to consider incremental density ratio estimation along generalized geodesics on this manifold. To achieve such a method requires Monte Carlo sampling along geodesics via transformations of the two distributions. We show how to implement an iterative algorithm to sample along these geodesics and show how changing the distances along the geodesic affect the variance and accuracy of the estimation of the density ratio. }

We first derive the asymptotics of the two-stage training framework using linear regression as a preliminary. Then, we analyze the convergence of two-layer neural networks in the two-stage framework. The analysis considers two different regimes: in the first stage of the framework, it is a high-dimensional regime, and in the second stage, the sample size is much larger than the data dimension. To analyze adversarial training, we track the change of the adversarial attack, and reveal that training with two-layer neural networks gives a prediction performance similar to training a linear model with some particular $\mathcal{L}_2$ regularization corresponding to different regimes. To highlight our technical contribution, we are the first to investigate adversarial training in two-layer neural networks under moderate attack strength, which is different from most existing literature in vanishing attack strength. }

Building on this principle, we propose a new class of bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable within the system. To this end, we develop an approximated, analytical physics-based representation of the entropy to forecast the information gain of each action and greedily choose the one with the largest information gain. This method yields strong performances in classical bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we prove its asymptotic optimality for the multi-armed bandit problem with Gaussian rewards. Since it encompasses the system's properties in a single, global functional, this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings. This calls for further investigation of information maximization approaches for multi-armed bandit problems. }

More specifically, we focus on how training steps $T$ and step-size $\eta$ might affect generalization in smooth stochastic convex optimization (SCO) problems. Recent works show that in some cases longer training can hurt generalization. Our work reexamines this for smooth SCO and find that the conclusion can be case-dependent. In particular, we first study SCO problems when the loss is \emph{realizable}, i.e. an optimal solution minimizes all the data points.  Our work provides excess risk lower bounds for Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and finds that longer training may not hurt generalization. In the short training scenario $\eta T = O(n)$ ($n$ is sample size), our lower bounds tightly match and certify the respective upper bounds. However, for the long training scenario where $\eta T =O(n)$, our analysis reveals a gap between the lower and upper bounds, indicating that longer training does hurt generalization for realizable objectives.  A conjecture is proposed that the gap can be closed by improving upper bounds, supported by analyses in two special instances. Moreover, besides the realizable setup, we also provide first tight excess risk lower bounds for GD and SGD under the general non-realizable smooth SCO setting, suggesting that existing stability analyses are tight in step-size and iteration dependence, and that overfitting provably happens when there is no interpolating minimum. }

In this work, we introduce a new class of solvable MFGs, named the "fully herding class", which expands the known solvable class of MFGs and for the first time includes problems with multiple equilibria. We propose a direct policy optimization method, Accelerated Single-loop Actor Critic Algorithm for Mean Field Games (ASAC-MFG), that provably finds a global equilibrium for MFGs within this class, under suitable access to a single trajectory of Markovian samples. Different from the prior methods, ASAC-MFG is single-loop and single-sample-path. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of ASAC-MFG to a mean field equilibrium via new techniques that we develop for multi-time-scale stochastic approximation. We support the theoretical results with illustrative numerical simulations.
    
    When the mean field does not affect the transition and reward, a MFG reduces to a Markov decision process (MDP) and ASAC-MFG becomes an actor-critic algorithm for finding the optimal policy in average-reward MDPs, with a sample complexity matching the state-of-the-art. Previous works derive the complexity assuming a contraction on the Bellman operator, which is invalid for average-reward MDPs. We match the rate while removing the untenable assumption through an improved Lyapunov function. }

Through the Stein operator, KSD allows the construction of powerful goodness-of-fit tests where it is sufficient to know the target distribution up to a multiplicative constant. However, the typical U- and V-statistic-based KSD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity, which hinders their application in large-scale settings.

We further derive the impacts of two privacy defences, i.e. adding Gaussian noise and sub-sampling, and that of target misspecification on optimal attacks. As by-products of our novel analysis of the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test, we provide a new covariance attack which generalises and improves the scalar product attack.

    abstract = { Nearly all identifiability results in unsupervised representation learning inspired by, e.g., independent component analysis, factor analysis, and causal representation learning, rely on assumptions of additive independent noise or noiseless regimes. In contrast, we study the more general case where noise can take arbitrary forms, depend on latent variables, and be non-invertibly entangled within a nonlinear function. We propose a general framework for identifying latent variables in the nonparametric noisy settings. We first show that, under suitable conditions, the generative model is identifiable up to certain submanifold indeterminacies even in the presence of non-negligible noise. Furthermore, under the structural or distributional variability conditions, we prove that latent variables of the general nonlinear models are identifiable up to trivial indeterminacies. Based on the proposed theoretical framework, we have also developed corresponding estimation methods and validated them in various synthetic and real-world settings. Interestingly, our estimate of the true GDP growth from alternative measurements suggests more insightful information on the economies than official reports. We expect our framework to provide new insight into how both researchers and practitioners deal with latent variables in real-world scenarios. }

One of these SSL criteria is to maximize the entropy of a set of embeddings in some compact space. But the goal of maximizing the embedding entropy often depends---whether explicitly or implicitly---upon high dimensional entropy estimates, which typically perform poorly in more than a few dimensions. In this paper, we motivate an effective entropy maximization criterion (E2MC), defined in terms of easy-to-estimate, low-dimensional constraints. We demonstrate that using it to continue training an already-trained SSL model for only a handful of epochs leads to a consistent and, in some cases, significant improvement in downstream performance. We perform careful ablation studies to show that the improved performance is due to the proposed add-on criterion. We also show that continued pre-training with alternative criteria does not lead to notable improvements, and in some cases, even degrades performance. }

Multiple authors have proposed Bayesian Multinomial Logistic-Normal Dynamic Linear Models (MLN-DLMs) as a flexible approach to modeling these data. However,  adoption of these methods has been limited by computational challenges. This article develops an efficient and accurate approach to posterior state estimation, called Fenrir. Our approach relies on a novel algorithm for MAP estimation and an accurate approximation to a key posterior marginal of the model. As there are no equivalent methods against which we can compare, we also develop an optimized Stan implementation of MLN-DLMs. Our experiments suggest that Fenrir can be three orders of magnitude more efficient than Stan and can even be incorporated into larger sampling schemes for joint inference of model hyperparameters. Our methods are made available to the community as a user-friendly software library written in C++ with an R interface. }

We go beyond the conventional inverse optimization by building upon prediction market, where multiple agents submit their beliefs until converging to market equilibria. The market equilibria express the crowd consensus on a desirable state, effectively eschewing the subjective design. To this end, we derive a proper scoring rule for prediction market design in the context of inverse optimization. }

While there have been a few proposed algorithms, their performance analyses have been limited to their biases rather than a precise error metric. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called HAVER (Head AVERaging) and analyze its mean squared error. Our analysis reveals that HAVER has a compelling performance in two respects. First, HAVER estimates the maximum mean as well as the oracle who knows the identity of the best distribution and reports its sample mean. Second, perhaps surprisingly, HAVER exhibits even better rates than this oracle when there are many distributions near the best one. Both of these improvements are the first of their kind in the literature, and we also prove that the naive algorithm that reports the largest empirical mean does not achieve these bounds.  Finally, we confirm our theoretical findings via numerical experiments where we implement HAVER in bandit, Q-learning, and MCTS algorithms. In these experiments, HAVER consistently outperforms the baseline methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across different applications. }

In addition to being robust in the infinite-dimensional setting, we prove that the acceptance probabilities of the proposed algorithms approach 1 as the width of the network increases, independently of any stepsize tuning. Moreover, we examine and compare how the mixing speeds of the underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin samplers are influenced by changes in the network width in some real-world cases. Our findings suggest that, in wide Bayesian Neural Networks configurations, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm allows for a scalable and more efficient sampling of the reparametrised posterior distribution, as also  evidenced by a higher effective sample size and improved diagnostic results compared with the other analysed algorithms. }

Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs the Skellam distribution for analyzing signed networks combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models. Finally, SGAAE allows for interpretable visualizations in the polytope space, revealing the distinct aspects of the network, as well as, how nodes are expressing them. }

The resulting DM-based denoiser can be conveniently employed using a pre-trained DM, being particularly fast by truncating reverse diffusion steps and not requiring stochastic re-sampling. We present a comprehensive (non-)asymptotic optimality analysis of the proposed diffusion-based denoiser, demonstrating polynomial-time convergence to the CME under mild conditions. Our analysis also derives a novel Lipschitz constant that depends solely on the DM's hyperparameters. Further, we offer a new perspective on DMs, showing that they inherently combine an asymptotically optimal denoiser with a powerful generator, modifiable by switching re-sampling in the reverse process on or off. The theoretical findings are thoroughly validated with experiments based on various benchmark datasets. }

Unlike prior work, our approach does not rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a bounded domain, boundedness of the operator or a light-tailed distribution. We prove a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^{-1/2})$ average-iterate convergence rate of the restricted merit function under an affine noise assumption, matching the optimal rate up to log factors. In addition, we improve the convergence rate to $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1})$ under a strong growth condition, characterizing the field of cutting-edge machine learning models and matching the optimal rate for the \textit{deterministic regime}. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments on saddle point problems. Our results suggest that the adaptive step sizes automatically take advantage of the structure of the noise and observe improved convergence in certain settings, such as when the strong growth condition holds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method  for root-finding problems under mild assumptions that adapts to the structure of the noise to obtain an improved convergence rate. }

We direct our focus to the complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task. A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks. Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count of $ m \geq 2^{2k-2} \cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1} $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $. Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition problems. By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms in attention matrices of one-layer Transformers. Our work stands as a significant stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of complex algebraic tasks. }

We hereby propose Elastic Representation (ElRep) to learn features by imposing Nuclear- and Frobenius-norm penalties on the representation from the last layer of a neural network. Similar to the elastic net, ElRep enjoys the benefits of learning important features without losing feature diversity. The proposed method is simple yet effective. It can be integrated into many deep learning approaches to mitigate spurious correlations and improve group robustness. Moreover, we theoretically show that ElRep has minimum negative impacts on in-distribution predictions. This is a remarkable advantage over approaches that prioritize minority groups at the cost of overall performance. }

Feature representation learning offers a robust solution to this issue. However, a fundamental challenge remains in devising the optimal strategy for feature selection. Existing literature is somewhat paradoxical: some advocate for learning invariant features from source domains, while others favor more diverse features. For better understanding, we propose a statistical framework that evaluates the utilities of the features (i.e., how differently the features are used in each source task) based on the variance of their correlation to $y$ across different domains. Under our framework, we design and analyze a learning procedure consisting of learning
        content features (comprising both invariant and approximately shared features) from source tasks and fine-tuning them on the target task. Our theoretical analysis highlights the significance of learning approximately shared features---beyond strictly invariant ones---when distribution shifts occur. Our analysis also yields an improved population risk on target tasks compared to previous results. Inspired by our theory, we introduce ProjectionNet, a practical method to distinguish content features from environmental features via \textit{explicit feature space control}, further consolidating our theoretical findings. }

Despite their practical importance, these metrics lack comprehensive theoretical analysis. In this paper, we investigate these EU metrics by providing their novel relationship to excess risk, which allows for a convergence analysis based on PAC-Bayesian theory. Based on these analyses, we then demonstrate that some existing objective functions of VI  regularize EU metrics in different ways leading to different performance in EU evaluation.

In this paper, we first show that this architecture has some systematic bias that cannot be mitigated regardless of model size and data size. We then propose SiCL, a DNN-based SCL method that predicts a skeleton matrix together with a v-tensor (a third-order tensor representing the v-structures). According to the Markov Equivalence Class (MEC) theory, both the skeleton and the v-structures are \emph{identifiable} causal structures under the canonical MEC setting, so predictions about skeleton and v-structures do not suffer from the identifiability limit in causal discovery, thus SiCL can avoid the systematic bias in Node-Edge architecture, and enable consistent estimators for causal discovery. Moreover, SiCL is also equipped with a specially designed pairwise encoder module with a unidirectional attention layer to model both internal and external relationships of pairs of nodes. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that SiCL significantly outperforms other DNN-based SCL approaches. }

Our method of selecting the number of communities is based on a sequential testing framework. In each step, the weighted DCSBM is fitted via some spectral clustering method. A key component of our method is matrix scaling on the estimated variance profile matrix. The resulting scaling factors can be used to normalize the adjacency matrix, from which the test statistic is then obtained. Under mild conditions on the weighted DCSBM, our proposed procedure is shown to be consistent in estimating the true number of communities. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real-world network data demonstrate the desirable empirical properties of our method. }

Taking an alternative approach, we propose to address these issues from a data-driven perspective by computing empirical error estimates. The proposed error estimates are highly versatile, and we demonstrate this in four use cases: Laplacian matrix approximation, graph cut queries, graph-structured regression, and spectral clustering. Moreover, we provide two theoretical guarantees for the error estimates, and explain why the cost of computing them is manageable in comparison to the overall cost of a typical graph sparsification workflow. }

To complement the theoretical results and investigate the utility-privacy trade-off, we defined a natural evaluation metric of the defense methods with similar utility loss among the strongest attacks.

To address this limitation, we propose a locally private sampling framework that leverages both the private and public datasets of each user. Specifically, we assume each user has two distributions: $p$ and $q$ that represent their private and public datasets, respectively. The objective is to design a mechanism that generates a private sample approximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving  $q$. We frame this objective as a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility measure. We fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general $f$-divergences provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this optimal mechanism is universal across all $f$-divergences. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our minimax optimal mechanism compared to the state-of-the-art private sampler. }

The concept of $\textit{variable importance}$ is an interpretability measure that applies to any predictive model and assesses how much a variable or set of variables improves prediction performance. When the number of variables is large, estimating variable importance presents a significant challenge because re-training neural networks or other black-box algorithms requires significant additional computation. In this paper, we address this challenge for algorithms using gradient descent and gradient boosting (e.g. neural networks, gradient-boosted decision trees). By using the ideas of early stopping of gradient-based methods in combination with warm-start using the $\textit{dropout}$ method, we develop a scalable method to estimate variable importance for any algorithm that can be expressed as an $\textit{iterative kernel update equation}$.  Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees by using the  theory for early stopping of kernel-based methods for  neural networks with sufficient large width and gradient-boosting decision trees that use symmetric tree as a weaker learner. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through simulations and a real data example which illustrates the computational benefit of early stopping rather than fully re-training the model as well as the increased accuracy of taking initial steps from the dropout solution. }

Control of the learning rate provably ensures conditions for ergodicity are satisfied.  The methodology is used to construct a gradient-free sampler that out-performs a popular gradient-free adaptive Metropolis--Hastings algorithm on $\approx$90\% of tasks in the \emph{PosteriorDB} benchmark. }

However, such models are necessarily simplified descriptions of the real world.  Generalised Bayesian methodologies have been proposed for inference with misspecified models, but these are typically associated with vanishing parameter uncertainty as more data are observed.  In the context of a misspecified deterministic mathematical model, this has the undesirable consequence that posterior predictions become deterministic and certain, while being incorrect.  Taking this observation as a starting point, we propose \emph{Prediction-Centric Uncertainty Quantification}, where a mixture distribution based on the deterministic model confers improved uncertainty quantification in the predictive context.  Computation of the mixing distribution is cast as a (regularised) gradient flow of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), enabling consistent numerical approximations to be obtained.  Results are reported on both a toy model from population ecology and a real model of protein signalling in cell biology. }

The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect a user's daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs. We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial. }

In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4\% in IID and up to 15.8\% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2\%. }

We demonstrate that while mixup improves model performance, it can distort key statistical properties such as variance, potentially leading to unintended consequences in data synthesis. To address this, we propose a novel mixup method that incorporates a generalized and flexible weighting scheme, better preserving the original data's structure. Through theoretical developments, we provide conditions under which our proposed method maintains the (co)variance and distributional properties of the original dataset. Numerical experiments confirm that the new approach not only preserves the statistical characteristics of the original data but also sustains model performance across repeated synthesis, alleviating concerns of model collapse identified in previous research. }

Assuming bounded and Lipschitz logit functions, our results show that in-sample prediction error decays optimally with the number of tokens, whereas out-of-sample error incurs an additional term related to the mixing properties of the Markov chain. These rates depend on the statistical complexity of the hypothesis class and can lead to generalization errors that do not scale exponentially with the order of the Markov chain---unlike classical $k$-gram estimators.

However, most existing works focus on a finite, small set of agents or assume complete knowledge of the game, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios involving large populations and model uncertainty. To address this gap, we study the design of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with density-independent transitions, where both the transition dynamics and intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This setting presents non-trivial challenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents to explore for its model learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer them to converge to desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments. Assuming agents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic exploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret guarantees for the cumulative gaps between the agents' behaviors and the desired ones. In terms of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total incentive payments incur only sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline steering strategy that stabilizes the target policy as an equilibrium. Our work presents an effective framework for steering agents behaviors in large-population systems under uncertainty. }

In this paper, we cast the causal partial identification problem in the framework of MOT with $K$ margins and $d$-dimensional outcomes and obtain the exact partial identified set. In order to estimate the partial identified set via MOT, statistically,
    we establish a convergence rate of the plug-in MOT estimator for the $\ell_2$ cost function stemming from the variance minimization problem and prove it is minimax optimal for arbitrary $K$ and $d \le 4$.

In this work, we prove the first polynomial iteration complexity under the realistic bounded support assumption for these two implementations.

We show that this tension leads rational utility-maximizing systems to frequently withhold recourse, resulting in decreased population utility, particularly impacting sensitive groups. To mitigate these effects, we explore the role of recourse subsidies, finding them effective in increasing the provision of recourse actions by rational systems, as well as lowering the potential social cost and mitigating unfairness caused by recourse withholding. }

The target is chosen to be a properly parametrized Boltzmann distribution. For the purpose of global optimization, we adapt the generic SVGD theoretical framework allowing to address more general target distributions over a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and we prove SBS's asymptotic convergence. In addition to the main SBS algorithm, we present two variants: the SBS-PF that includes a particle filtering strategy, and the SBS-HYBRID one that uses SBS or SBS-PF as a continuation after other particle- or distribution-based optimization methods. A detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods on benchmark functions demonstrates that SBS and its variants are highly competitive, while the combination of the two variants provides the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. }

Focusing on the mixed setting (continuous $X$ and discrete $Y$), here we highlight the upward bias of empirical $\mathcal{V}$-information, $\hat I_{\mathcal{V}}(X \rightarrow Y)$, even when $\mathcal{V}$ is low-complexity (e.g., shallow neural networks). To mitigate this bias, we introduce $\mathcal{V}$-Information Growth (VI-Growth), defined as $\\hat I_{\mathcal{V}}(X \rightarrow Y) - \hat I_{\mathcal{V}}(X' \rightarrow Y')$, where $X', Y' \sim P_X P_Y$ represent independent variables. While VI-Growth effectively counters over-estimation, more complex predictive families may lead to under-estimation. To address this, we construct a sequence of predictive families $\mathcal{V}_1, \mathcal{V}_2, \ldots, \mathcal{V}$ of increasing complexity and compute the maximum of VI-Growth across these families, yielding the ordered VI-Growth (O-VIG). We provide theoretical results that justify this approach, showing that O-VIG is a provably tighter lower bound for the true $\mathcal{V}$-Information than empirical $\mathcal{V}$-Information itself, and exhibits stronger convergence properties than $\mathcal{V}$-Information. Empirically, O-VIG alleviates bias and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both MI estimation and dataset complexity estimation, demonstrating its practical utility. }

This mismatch is often not an instance of covariate shift (as commonly formalized) because the validation and test locations are fixed (e.g., on a grid or at select points) rather than i.i.d. from two distributions. In the present work, we formalize a check on validation methods: that they become arbitrarily accurate as validation data becomes arbitrarily dense. We show that classical and covariate-shift methods can fail this check.

We connect this observation to Riemannian optimization and view overparametrized GD with identical initialization as a Riemannian GD. We use this fact for solving non-negative least squares (NNLS), an important problem behind many techniques, e.g., non-negative matrix factorization. We show that gradient flow on the reparametrized objective converges globally to NNLS solutions, providing convergence rates also for its discretized counterpart. Unlike previous methods, we do not rely on the calculation of exponential maps or geodesics.

Each node $v$ in fixed graph deals with a two-sample testing problem between two node-specific probability density functions, $p_v$ and $q_v$. The goal is to identify nodes where the null hypothesis $p_v = q_v$ should be rejected, under the assumption that connected nodes would yield similar test outcomes. We propose the non-parametric collaborative two-sample testing (CTST) framework that efficiently leverages the graph structure and minimizes the assumptions over $p_v$ and $q_v$. CTST integrates elements from f-divergence estimation, Kernel Methods, and Multitask Learning. We use synthetic experiments and a real sensor network detecting seismic activity to demonstrate that CTST outperforms state-of-the-art non-parametric statistical tests that apply at each node independently, hence disregard the geometry of the problem. }

In terms of structure, we only assume that the target distribution satisfies either a Log-Sobolev  or a Poincare inequality and a local Lipschitz smoothness assumption with modulus growing possibly polynomially at infinity. This set of assumptions greatly exceeds the operational limits of the "vanilla" ULA, making sampling from such distributions a highly involved affair. To account for this, we introduce a taming scheme which is tailored to the growth and decay properties of the target distribution, and we provide explicit non-asymptotic guarantees for the proposed sampler in terms of the KL divergence, total variation, and Wasserstein distance to the target distribution. }

This scheme seamlessly integrates into most federated learning algorithms while preserving rigorous convergence guarantees, as demonstrated in the context of FedAvg. Additionally, when enforcing differential privacy, the kernel-based MMD regularization enables straightforward analysis through a change of kernel, leveraging an intuitive interpretation of kernel convolution.

In this context, we examine the question of statistical efficiency in kernel-based RL within the reward-free RL framework, specifically asking: how many samples are required to design a near-optimal policy?
        Existing work addresses this question under restrictive assumptions about the class of kernel functions. We first explore this question assuming a generative model, then relax this assumption at the cost of increasing the sample complexity by a factor of $H$, the episode length.  We tackle this fundamental problem using a broad class of kernels and a simpler algorithm compared to prior work. Our approach derives new confidence intervals for kernel ridge regression, specific to our RL setting, that may be of broader applicability.

However, despite advances in Bayesian machine learning models, most AML research remains concentrated on classical techniques. Therefore, we focus on extending the white-box model poisoning paradigm to attack generic Bayesian inference, highlighting its vulnerability in adversarial contexts. A suite of attacks are developed that allow an attacker to steer the Bayesian posterior toward a target distribution through the strategic deletion and replication of true observations, even when only sampling access to the posterior is available.
    Analytic properties of these algorithms are proven and their performance is empirically examined in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. With relatively little effort, the attacker is able to substantively alter the Bayesian's beliefs and, by accepting more risk, they can mold these beliefs to their will. By carefully constructing the adversarial posterior, surgical poisoning is achieved such that only targeted inferences are corrupted and others are minimally disturbed. }

Concept erasure is useful in several applications, such as removing sensitive concepts to achieve fairness and interpreting the impact of specific concepts on a model's performance. Previous concept erasure techniques have prioritized robustly erasing concepts over retaining the utility of the resultant representations. However, there seems to be an inherent tradeoff between erasure and retaining utility, making it unclear how to achieve perfect concept erasure while maintaining high utility. In this paper, we offer a fresh perspective toward solving this problem by quantifying the fundamental limits of concept erasure through an information-theoretic lens. Using these results, we investigate constraints on the data distribution and the erasure functions required to achieve the limits of perfect concept erasure. Empirically, we show that the derived erasure functions achieve the optimal theoretical bounds. Additionally, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets using GPT-4 representations. }

We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments. }

To address this gap, we propose a methodology for learning the distribution map that encapsulates the long-term impacts of predictive models on the population. Specifically, we model agents' responses as a cost-adjusted utility maximization problem and propose estimates for said cost. Our approach leverages optimal transport to align pre-model exposure (\emph{ex ante}) and post-model exposure (\emph{ex post}) distributions. We provide a rate of convergence for this proposed estimate and assess its quality through empirical demonstrations on a credit scoring dataset. }

To this end, we first propose a novel statistical model for the data-generating process (DGP) of heterogeneous graph data, namely hidden Markov networks for heterogeneous graphs (H2MN). Then we formalize HGSL as a maximum a-posterior estimation problem parameterized by such DGP and derive an alternating optimization method to obtain a solution together with a theoretical justification of the optimization conditions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our proposed method excels in learning structure on heterogeneous graphs in terms of edge type identification and edge weight recovery. }

We conduct an exact theoretical analysis to demonstrate that multi-head attention with a substantial embedding dimension performs better than single-head attention.
    When the number of in-context examples $D$ increases, the prediction loss using single-/multi-head attention is in $O(1/D)$, and the one for multi-head attention has a smaller multiplicative constant. In addition to the simplest data distribution setting, our technical framework in calculating the exact convergence further facilitates studying more scenarios, e.g., noisy labels, local examples, correlated features, and prior knowledge. We observe that, in general, multi-head attention is preferred over single-head attention. Our results verify the effectiveness of the design of multi-head attention in the transformer architecture. }

Existing approaches to noise detection often rely on external facts, logical rule constraints, or structural embeddings. These methods are often challenged by imperfect entity alignment, flexible knowledge graph construction, and overfitting on structures. In this paper, we propose to exploit the consistency between entity and relation type information for noise detection, resulting a novel self-supervised knowledge graph denoising method that avoids those problems. We formalize \textit{type inconsistency} noise as triples that deviate from the majority with respect to type-dependent reasoning along the topological structure. Specifically, we first extract a compact representation of a given knowledge graph via an encoder that models the type dependencies of triples. Then, the decoder reconstructs the original input knowledge graph based on the compact representation. It is worth noting that, our proposal has the potential to address the problems of knowledge graph compression and completion, although this is not our focus. For the specific task of noise detection, the discrepancy between the reconstruction results and the input knowledge graph provides an opportunity for denoising, which is facilitated by the type consistency embedded in our method. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in detecting potential noise in real-world data. }

To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold.

One marginalizes out the leaf parameters and samples the tree shape and the inner parameters by Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms. The other marginalizes out both the leaf parameters and the tree shape based on a concept called meta-trees and approximates the posterior distribution for the inner parameters by a bagging-like method. In this paper, we propose a novel MH algorithm where the leaf parameters and the tree shape are marginalized out by using the meta-trees and only the inner parameters are sampled. Moreover, we update all the inner parameters simultaneously in each MH step. This algorithm accelerates the convergence and mixing of the Markov chain. We evaluate our algorithm on various benchmark datasets with other state-of-the-art methods. Further, our model provides a novel statistical evaluation of feature importance. }

    abstract = { Online reinforcement learning (RL) typically requires online interaction data to learn a policy for a target task, but collecting such data can be high-stakes. This prompts interest in leveraging historical data to improve sample efficiency. The historical data may come from outdated or related source environments with different dynamics. It remains unclear how to effectively use such data in the target task to provably enhance learning and sample efficiency. To address this, we propose a hybrid transfer RL (HTRL) setting, where an agent learns in a target environment while accessing offline data from a source environment with shifted dynamics. We show that -- without information on the dynamics shift -- general shifted-dynamics data, even with subtle shifts, does not reduce sample complexity in the target environment.  However, focusing on HTRL with prior information on the degree of the dynamics shift, we design HySRL, a transfer algorithm that outperforms pure online RL with problem-dependent sample complexity guarantees. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that HySRL surpasses the state-of-the-art pure online RL baseline. }

    Current HTE evaluation methods rely on additional estimation or matching on test data, often ignoring the uncertainty introduced and potentially leading to incorrect conclusions.
    We propose incorporating uncertainty quantification into HTE estimator comparisons. In addition, we suggest shifting the focus to the estimation and inference of the relative error between methods rather than their absolute errors. Methodology-wise, we develop a relative error estimator based on the efficient influence function and establish its asymptotic distribution for inference. Compared to absolute error-based methods, the relative error estimator  (1) is less sensitive to the error of nuisance function estimators, satisfying a "global double robustness" property, and (2) its confidence intervals are often narrower, making it more powerful for determining the more accurate HTE estimator. Through extensive empirical study of the ACIC challenge benchmark datasets, we show that the relative error-based method more effectively identifies the better HTE estimator with statistical confidence, even with a moderately large test dataset or inaccurate
    nuisance estimators. }

To address these challenges, we investigate the fitting assumption for PFNs and input samples. Building on this understanding, we propose \emph{BoostPFN} designed to enhance the performance of these networks, especially for large-scale datasets. We also theoretically validate the convergence of BoostPFN and our empirical results demonstrate that the BoostPFN method can outperform standard PFNs with the same size of training samples in large datasets and achieve a significant acceleration in training times compared to other established baselines in the field, including widely-used Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs), deep learning methods and AutoML systems. High performance is maintained for up to 50x of the pre-training size of PFNs, substantially extending the limit of training samples. Through this work, we address the challenges of efficiently handling large datasets via PFN-based models, paving the way for faster and more effective tabular data classification training and prediction process. }

We first propose a general data poisoning formulation in learning from human preferences and then study it for two popular paradigms, namely: (a) reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that operates by learning a reward model using preferences; (b) direct preference optimization (DPO) that directly optimizes policy using preferences. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of data poisoning in a setting where the attacker is allowed to augment a pre-existing dataset and also study its special case where the attacker can synthesize the entire preference dataset from scratch. As our main results, we provide lower/upper bounds on the number of samples required to enforce $\pi^\dagger$.

DCE is particularly beneficial for stakeholders making strategic decisions based on statistical data analysis, as it makes the statistical distribution of the counterfactual resembles the one of the factual when aligning model outputs with a target distribution---something that the existing CE methods cannot fully achieve.
    We leverage optimal transport (OT) to formulate a chance-constrained optimization problem, deriving a counterfactual distribution aligned with its factual counterpart, supported by statistical confidence.

The best arm of any given objective is the arm with the largest component of mean corresponding to the objective. The end goal is to identify the best arm of {\em every} objective in the shortest (expected) time subject to an upper bound on the probability of error (i.e., fixed-confidence regime). We establish a problem-dependent lower bound on the limiting growth rate of the expected stopping time, in the limit of vanishing error probabilities. This lower bound, we show, is characterised by a max-min optimisation problem that is computationally expensive to solve at each time step. We propose an algorithm that uses the novel idea of {\em surrogate proportions} to sample the arms at each time step, eliminating the need to solve the max-min optimisation problem at each step. We demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In addition, we provide extensive empirical studies to substantiate the efficiency of our algorithm.  While existing works on pure exploration with multi-objective multi-armed bandits predominantly focus on {\em Pareto front identification}, our work fills the gap in the literature by conducting a formal investigation of the multi-objective best arm identification problem. }

In this work, we propose a framework based on symmetry-based structured matrices to build approximately equivariant NNs with fewer parameters. Our approach unifies the aforementioned areas using Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design of structured matrices similar to LDR matrices, which can generalize all the elementary operations of a CNN from cyclic groups to arbitrary finite groups. We show GMs can also generalize classical LDR theory to general discrete groups, enabling a natural formalism for approximate equivariance. We test GM-based architectures on various tasks with relaxed symmetry and find that our framework performs competitively with approximately equivariant NNs and other structured matrix-based methods, often with one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. }

We prove that both imputation and P-b-P approaches are ill-specified in a logistic regression framework, thus questioning the relevance of such approaches to handle missing data. The most favorable auspices to perform classification with missing data concern P-b-P LDA methods.

In this work we utilize the geometric median of means to develop a robust score matching procedure that yields consistent parameter estimates in settings where the observed data has been contaminated. A special appeal of the proposed method is that it retains convexity in exponential family models. The new method is therefore particularly attractive for non-Gaussian, exponential family graphical models where evaluation of normalizing constants is intractable. Support recovery guarantees for such models when contamination is present are provided. Additionally, support recovery is studied in numerical experiments and on a precipitation dataset. We demonstrate that the proposed robust score matching estimator performs comparably to the standard score matching estimator when no contamination is present but greatly outperforms this estimator in a setting with contamination. }

We examine the vulnerability of neural multiset functions commonly used for this purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize a GNN's susceptibility to losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis of the impact of homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation functions on GNN robustness.

One problem with existing online SMC methods for MLE is that the score estimators are inconsistent, i.e. the bias does not vanish with increasing particle size. In this paper, two SMC algorithms are proposed based on an importance sampling weight function to use each set of generated particles more efficiently. The first one is an offline algorithm that locally approximates the likelihood function using importance sam- pling, where the locality is adapted by the effective sample size (ESS). The second one is a semi-online algorithm that has a compu- tational cost linear in the particle size and uses score estimators that are consistent. We study its consistency and asymptotic normal- ity. Their computational superiority is illus- trated in numerical studies for long time se- ries. }

    abstract = { Class imbalance (CI) is a longstanding problem in machine learning, slowing down training and reducing performances. Although empirical remedies exist, it is often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory. We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that, depending on the specific problem setting, one source or another might dominate. We further find that the optimal train imbalance is generally different from 50\%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI and pave the way for integrated approaches to the topic. }

This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises information in both the function's input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING's superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture and significantly faster generation times.

In stark contrast to related literature, we do not impose uniform boundedness on the Stein kernel. Instead, we exploit the potential boundedness of the Stein kernel at arbitrary point evaluations to define test martingales, that give way to the subsequent novel sequential tests. We prove the validity of the test, as well as an asymptotic lower bound for the logarithmic growth of the wealth process under the alternative.  We further illustrate the empirical performance of the test with a variety of distributions, including restricted Boltzmann machines. }

Therefore, robust algorithms are crucial---ones that can recover model parameters even when the data deviates from the assumed distribution. In this work, we propose SubSearch, an algorithm for robustly estimating SBM parameters by exploring the space of subgraphs in search of one that closely aligns with the model's assumptions. Our approach also functions as an outlier detection method, properly identifying nodes responsible for the graph's deviation from the model and going beyond simple techniques like pruning high-degree nodes. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. }

We prove that the regret of $\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$ scales as $\tilde O(\sqrt{H^3 |S| |A| T / M})$, with a small additional term due to heterogeneity, where $|S|$ is the number of states, $|A|$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode length,  $M$ is the number of agents, and $T$ is the number of episodes.

We delve into the investigation of a non-convex regularization, referred to as transformed $L_1$ (TL1), which interpolates between the rank and the nuclear norm of matrices through a hyper-parameter $a \in (0, \infty)$. While some literature adopts such regularization for matrix completion, it primarily addresses scenarios with uniformly missing entries and focuses on algorithmic advances. To fill in the gap in the current literature, we provide a comprehensive statistical analysis for the estimator from a TL1-regularized recovery model under general sampling distribution. In particular, we show that when $a$ is sufficiently large, the matrix recovered by the TL1-based model enjoys a convergence rate measured by the Frobenius norm, comparable to that of the model based on the nuclear norm, despite the challenges posed by the non-convexity of the TL1 regularization. When $a$ is small enough, we show that the rank of the estimated matrix remains a constant order when the true matrix is exactly low-rank. A trade-off between controlling the error and the rank is established through different choices of tuning parameters. The appealing practical performance of TL1 regularization is demonstrated through a simulation study that encompasses various sampling mechanisms, as well as two real-world applications. Additionally, the role of the hyper-parameter $a$ on the TL1-based model is explored via experiments to offer guidance in practical scenarios. }

For the general task of metric learning, our framework leads to a simple and self-contained representer theorem and offers new geometric insights into the derivation of representer theorems for this task. In the case of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs), we illustrate how our representer theorem can be used to express the solution of the learning problems in terms of finite kernel terms similar to classical representer theorems. Lastly, our representer theorem leads to a novel nonlinear algorithm for metric and preference learning.

In this work, we define a complexity measure for explainers, globalness, which enables deeper understanding of the distribution of explanations produced by feature attribution and feature selection methods for a given dataset. We establish the axiomatic properties that any such measure should possess and prove that our proposed measure, Wasserstein Globalness, meets these criteria.

Our approach shows that even with restricted access, quality image reconstructions are possible, raising serious privacy concerns for patient data. Contributions include demonstrating that a combination of gradient-based methods and TCNNs yields potent reconstructions, even with limited model access, and providing a detailed analysis of how different input configurations impact reconstruction quality. We also evaluate the reconstructions as viable training data, finding that they can approximate real images well enough to use for model training.

Existing non-asymptotic analysis on MCMC with fixed step sizes indicates that the step size heavily relies on global smoothness. However, this choice does not utilize the local information and fails when the smoothness coefficient is hard to estimate. A tuning-free algorithm that can adaptively update stepsize is highly desirable.

This recursive training process raises concerns about the long-term impact on model quality. As models are recursively trained on generated data from previous rounds, their ability to capture the nuances of the original human-generated data may degrade. This is often referred to as model collapse. In this work, we ask how fast model collapse occurs for some well-studied distribution families under maximum likelihood (ML or near ML) estimation during recursive training. Surprisingly, even for fundamental distributions such as discrete and Gaussian distributions, the exact rate of model collapse is unknown. In this work, we theoretically characterize the rate of collapse in these fundamental settings and complement it with experimental evaluations. Our results show that for discrete distributions, the time to forget a symbol is approximately linearly dependent on the number of times it occurred in the original corpus, and for Gaussian models, the standard deviation reduces to zero roughly at $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of samples at each iteration. Both of these findings imply that model forgetting, at least in these simple distributions under near ML estimation with many samples, takes a long time. }

However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the parameter space of the aggregation of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting. }

To enable online VI in SSMs when the observations are received in real time, we propose maximising an IWAE-type variational lower bound on the asymptotic contrast function, rather than the standard IWAE ELBO, using stochastic approximation. Unlike the recursive maximum likelihood method, which directly maximises the asymptotic contrast, our approach, called online sequential IWAE (OSIWAE), allows for online learning of both model parameters and a Markovian recognition model for inferring latent states. By approximating filter state posteriors and their derivatives using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, we create a particle-based framework for online VI in SSMs. This approach is more theoretically well-founded than recently proposed online variational SMC methods. We provide rigorous theoretical results on the learning objective and a numerical study demonstrating the method's efficiency in learning model parameters and particle proposal kernels. }

This starkly contrasts with all existing stochastic second-order methods for non-convex problems, which typically require large batches.

    abstract = { The partial alignment and conflict of autonomous agents lead to mixed-motive scenarios in many real-world applications. However, agents may fail to cooperate in practice even when cooperation yields a better outcome. One well known reason for this failure comes from non-credible commitments. To facilitate commitments among agents for better cooperation, we define Markov Commitment Games (MCGs), a variant of commitment games, where agents can voluntarily commit to their proposed future plans. Based on MCGs, we propose a learnable commitment protocol via policy gradients. We further propose incentive-compatible learning to accelerate convergence to equilibria with better social welfare. Experimental results in challenging mixed-motive tasks demonstrate faster empirical convergence and higher returns for our method compared with its counterparts.

    abstract = { Stochastic simulation models are generative models that mimic complex systems to help with decision-making. The reliability of these models heavily depends on well-calibrated input model parameters. However, in many practical scenarios, only output-level data are available to learn the input model parameters, which is challenging due to the often intractable likelihood of the stochastic simulation model. Moreover, stochastic simulation models are frequently inexact, with discrepancies between the model and the target system. No existing methods can effectively learn and quantify the uncertainties of input parameters using only output-level data. In this paper, we propose to learn differentiable input parameters of stochastic simulation models using output-level data via kernel score minimization with stochastic gradient descent. We quantify the uncertainties of the learned input parameters using a frequentist confidence set procedure based on a new asymptotic normality result that accounts for model inexactness. The proposed method is evaluated on exact and inexact G/G/1 queueing models as well as a stochastic volatility model. }

We consider the dynamic setting with adversarial robustness, in which the \emph{adaptive} adversary can flip the label of an edge based on the current output of the algorithm. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that always maintains an $O(1)$-approximation to the optimal correlation clustering with $O(\log^{2}{n})$ amortized update time.

Our goal is to infer the unknown labels of a sequence of data by using weak supervision sources that provide independent noisy signals of the correct classification for each data point. This setting includes crowdsourcing and programmatic weak supervision. We focus on the non-stationary case, where the accuracy of the weak supervision sources can drift over time, e.g., because of changes in the underlying data distribution. Due to the drift, older data could provide misleading information to infer the label of the current data point. Previous work relied on a priori assumptions on the magnitude of the drift to decide how much data to use from the past. In contrast, our algorithm does not require any assumptions on the drift, and it adapts based on the input by dynamically varying its window size. In particular, at each step, our algorithm estimates the current accuracies of the weak supervision sources by identifying a window of past observations that guarantees a near-optimal minimization of the trade-off between the error due to the variance of the estimation and the error due to the drift. Experiments on synthetic and real-world labelers show that our approach adapts to the drift. }

However, since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently random, researchers including Tang et al.\ (2024) and Zhang et al.\ (2024a) have raised an important question: is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators sufficient to ensure the overall differential privacy of the algorithm? This work settles this question for a class of oracle-based optimization algorithms where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient estimates. In particular, we show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly convex objective functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD) is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random initialization and without revealing intermediate iterates, the privacy loss in ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when minimizing convex objective functions. }

     The canonical communication problem of estimating transmitted symbols from received observations can be modeled as an in-context learning problem: Received observations are a noisy function of transmitted symbols, and this function can be represented by an unknown parameter whose statistics depend on an unknown latent context. This problem, which we term in-context estimation (ICE), has significantly greater complexity than the extensively studied linear regression problem.
     The optimal solution to the ICE problem is a non-linear function of the underlying context. In this paper, we prove that, for a subclass of such problems, a single-layer softmax attention transformer (SAT) computes the optimal solution of the above estimation problem in the limit of large prompt length. We also prove that the optimal configuration of such a transformer is indeed the minimizer of the corresponding training loss. Further, we empirically demonstrate the proficiency of multi-layer transformers in efficiently solving broader in-context estimation problems. Through extensive simulations, we show that solving ICE problems using transformers significantly outperforms standard approaches. Moreover, just with a few context examples, it achieves the same performance as an estimator with perfect knowledge of the latent context. }

While extensive research has addressed the statistical accuracy of spectral estimators under a variety of conditions, most previous work has assumed that the signal eigenvectors are incoherent with respect to the standard basis. This assumption typically arises because of suboptimal dependence on coherence in one or more concentration inequalities.
    Using a new matrix concentration result that may be of independent interest, we establish estimation error bounds for eigenvector and eigenvalue recovery whose dependence on coherence significantly improves upon prior work. Our results imply that coherence-free bounds can be achieved when the standard deviation of the noise is comparable to its Orlicz 1-norm (i.e., its subexponential norm). This matches known minimax lower bounds under Gaussian noise up to logarithmic factors. }

In this work, we consider a novel setting where the global task distribution can be partitioned into a union of conditional task distributions. We then examine the use of task-specific prompts and prediction heads for learning the prior information associated with the conditional task distribution using a one-layer attention model. Our results on loss landscape show that task-specific prompts facilitate a covariance-mean decoupling where prompt-tuning explains the conditional mean of the distribution whereas the variance is learned/explained through in-context learning. Incorporating task-specific head further aids this process by entirely decoupling estimation of mean and variance components. This covariance-mean perspective similarly explains how jointly training prompt and attention weights can provably help over fine-tuning after pretraining. }

In this paper, we propose a distribution shift adaptation method for PU learning without assuming shift types by using a few PU data in the test distribution and PU data in the training distribution. Our method is based on the importance weighting, which learns the classifier in a principled manner by minimizing the importance-weighted training risk that approximates the test risk. Although existing methods require positive and negative data in both distributions for the importance weighting without assuming shift types, we theoretically show that it can be performed with only PU data in both distributions. Based on this finding, our neural network-based classifiers can be effectively trained by iterating the importance weight estimation and classifier learning. We show that our method outperforms various existing methods with seven real-world datasets. }

Although intuitive, the statistical benefit of the latter approach is not well understood yet is important to guide the prescriptive usage of machine learning. In this paper, we dissect the performance comparisons between these approaches in terms of the amount of model misspecification. In particular, we show how the integrated approach offers a ``universal double benefit'' on the top two dominating terms of regret when the underlying model is misspecified, while the traditional approach can be advantageous when the model is nearly well-specified. Our comparison is powered by finite-sample tail regret bounds that are derived via new higher-order expansions of regrets and the leveraging of a recent Berry-Esseen theorem. }

While efficient algorithms with regret upper bounds have emerged, limited attention has been given to the corresponding regret lower bounds, except for a recent lower bound for adversarial settings, which, however, has a gap with let known upper bounds. To this end, we herein provide the first comprehensive study on regret lower bounds across different settings and establish their tightness. Specifically, when the graphs exhibit good connectivity properties and the rewards are stochastically distributed, we demonstrate a lower bound of order $O(\log T)$ for instance-dependent bounds and $\sqrt{T}$ for mean-gap independent bounds which are tight. Assuming adversarial rewards, we establish a lower bound $O(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for connected graphs, thereby bridging the gap between the lower and upper bound in the prior work. We also show a linear regret lower bound when the graph is disconnected. These lower bounds are made possible through our newly constructed instances. In the numerical study, we assess the performance of various algorithms on these hard instances. While previous works have explored these settings with upper bounds, we provide a thorough study on tight lower bounds. }

This creates a tension: we need models that are interpretable---allowing human decision-makers to understand and justify predictions, but not transparent, so that the model's decision boundary is not easily replicated by attackers. Shielding the model's decision boundary is particularly challenging alongside the requirement of completely faithful explanations, since such explanations reveal the true logic of the model for an entire subspace around each query point. This work provides an approach, FaithfulDefense, that creates model explanations for logical models that are completely faithful, yet reveal as little as possible about the decision boundary.

    abstract = { Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be well-performed and versatile in inventory control (IC). However, further improvement of RL algorithms in the IC domain is impeded by two limitations of online experience. First, online experience is expensive to acquire in real-world applications. With the low sample efficiency nature of RL algorithms, it would take extensive time to collect enough data and train the RL policy to convergence. Second, online experience may not reflect the true demand due to the lost-sales phenomenon typical in IC, which makes the learning process more challenging. To address the above challenges, we propose a training framework that combines reinforcement learning with feedback graph (RLFG) and intrinsically motivated exploration (IME) to boost sample efficiency. In particular, we first leverage the MDP structure inherent in lost-sales IC problems and design the feedback graph (FG) tailored to lost-sales IC problems to generate abundant side experiences aiding in RL updates. Then we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of how the designed FG reduces the sample complexity of RL methods. Guided by these insights, we design an intrinsic reward to direct the RL agent to explore to the state-action space with more side experiences, further exploiting FG's capability. Experimental results on single-item, multi-item, and multi-echelon environments demonstrate that our method greatly improves the sample efficiency of applying RL in IC.

We introduce a statistical detection approach that improves the power of watermark detection, particularly in shorter texts. Our method leverages both the watermark key sequence and the next token probabilities (NTPs) to determine whether a text is generated by a large language model. We demonstrate the optimality of our approach and analyze its power properties. We also investigate an approach to estimating NTPs and extend our method to scenarios where texts face potential attacks such as substitutions, insertions, or deletions. We validate the effectiveness of our technique using texts generated by Meta-Llama-3-8B from Meta and Mistral-7B-v0.1 from Mistral AI, utilizing prompts extracted from Google's C4 dataset. In scenarios without attacks and with short text lengths, our method demonstrates approximately 65\% power improvement compared to the baseline method on average.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to understand ICL from a statistical perspective. First, we show that the perfectly pretrained LLMs perform Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) for ICL under a dynamic model of examples in the prompt. The average error analysis for ICL is then built for the perfectly pretrained LLMs with the analysis of BMA. Second, we demonstrate how the attention structure boosts the BMA implementation. With sufficient examples in the prompt, attention is proven to perform BMA under the Gaussian linear ICL model, which also motivates the explicit construction of the hidden concepts from the attention heads values. Finally, we analyze the pretraining behavior of LLMs. The pretraining error is decomposed as the generalization error and the approximation error. The generalization error is upper bounded via PAC-Bayes framework. Then the ICL average error of the pretrained LLMs is shown to be the sum of $O(T^{-1})$ and the pretraining error. In addition, we analyze the ICL performance of the pretrained LLMs with misspecified examples. }

Moreover, its density is very simple and has maximum-entropy, unlike previous Gaussian process-based approaches, which use wrapping or radial marginalization. For posterior inference, we introduce a new Stratonovich-like augmentation that lends itself to fast Gibbs sampling. We argue that transductive learning in these models favors a Bayesian approach to the parameters and apply our sampling scheme to the Double Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

Consequently, we present the bias-corrected CV estimator, which is the standard CV estimate supplemented by an estimate of the bias term. This concept was introduced in the literature only in the context of a linear model with squared error loss as the criterion for prediction performance. Our suggested bias-corrected CV estimator can be applied to any learning model, including deep neural networks, and to standard criteria for prediction performance for classification tasks, including misclassification rate, cross-entropy and hinge loss. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology in various scenarios where the data contains complex correlation structures (such as clustered and spatial relationships) with synthetic data and real-world datasets, providing evidence that the bias-corrected CV estimator is better than the standard CV estimator. }

In this paper, we introduce the truncated inverse-L{\'e}vy measure representation (TILe-Rep) that extends the decreasing atom weights representation of the beta process to general hyperparameters. The TILe-Rep fills the gap between the two stick-breaking representations in Teh et al.\ (2007) and Paisley et al.\ (2010). Moreover, it has a lower truncation error compared to other sequential representations of the beta process and potentially leads to the posterior consistency property of the Bayesian factor models. We demonstrate the usage of the TILe-Rep in the celebrated beta process factor analysis model and beta process sparse factor model. }

Alternatively, methods that sequentially create full clusters, do not provide assignment probabilities. In this paper, we introduce GFNCP, a novel framework for  amortized clustering. GFNCP is formulated as a Generative Flow Network with a shared energy-based parametrization of policy and reward. We show that the flow matching conditions are equivalent to consistency of the clustering posterior under marginalization, which in turn implies order invariance. GFNCP also outperforms existing methods in clustering performance on both synthetic and real-world data. }

This paper extends the use of these features to compositional GPs involving linear transformations. In particular, we introduce Ordinary Differential Equation(ODE)--based RKHS Fourier features that allow for adaptive amplitude and phase modulation through convolution operations. This convolutional formulation relates our work to recently proposed deep latent force models, a multi-layer structure designed for modelling nonlinear dynamical systems. By embedding these adjustable RKHS Fourier features within a doubly stochastic variational inference framework, our model exhibits improved predictive performance across various regression tasks. }

However, existing methods lack the capability to guarantee the reliability of FS under DA. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical method to statistically test FS reliability under DA, named SFS-DA (statistical FS-DA). The key strength of SFS-DA lies in its ability to control the false positive rate (FPR) below a pre-specified level $\alpha$ (e.g., 0.05) while maximizing the true positive rate. Compared to the literature on statistical FS, SFS-DA presents a unique challenge in addressing the effect of DA to ensure the validity of the inference on FS results. We overcome this challenge by leveraging the Selective Inference (SI) framework. Specifically, by carefully examining the FS process under DA whose operations can be characterized by linear and quadratic inequalities, we prove that achieving FPR control in SFS-DA is indeed possible. Furthermore, we enhance the true detection rate by introducing a more strategic approach. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets robustly support our theoretical results, showcasing the SFS-DA's superior performance. }

These constraints can come in the form of ancestral constraints that relate to the existence of paths between nodes. When the constraints are compiled into a directed acyclic graph, the complexity of learning with ancestral constraints is connected to the number of ideals of the constraint graph. First, we consider precedence constraints which define a partial order that the structure must obey. Taking the path cover number of the constraint graph as a parameter, we extend earlier results to the problems of sampling and weighted counting of network structures. We also consider the problems with related ancestral constraints which state that a node must or cannot be an ancestor of another. With positive ancestral constraints, we show that the problems are tractable under the additional assumption that the constraint graph has only a small number of incomparable edges. On the other hand, the optimization problem is NP-hard with negative ancestral constraints when the path cover number is at least two. Finally, we show that these problems become fixed-parameter tractable if the constraints are compatible with a subclass of partial orders called bucket orders. }

To combat the heavy tails, a general framework of nonlinear SGD methods is considered, subsuming several popular nonlinearities like sign, quantization, component-wise and joint clipping. In our work the nonlinearity is treated in a black-box manner, allowing us to establish unified guarantees for a broad range of nonlinear methods. For symmetric noise and non-convex costs we establish convergence of gradient norm-squared, at a rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(t^{-1/4})$, while for the last iterate of strongly convex costs we establish convergence to the population optima, at a rate $\mathcal{O}(t^{-\zeta})$, where $\zeta \in (0,1)$ depends on noise and problem parameters. Further, if the noise is a (biased) mixture of symmetric and non-symmetric components, we show convergence to a neighbourhood of stationarity, whose size depends on the mixture coefficient, nonlinearity and noise. Compared to state-of-the-art, who only consider clipping and require unbiased noise with bounded $p$-th moments, $p \in (1,2]$, we provide guarantees for a broad class of nonlinearities, without any assumptions on noise moments. While the rate exponents in state-of-the-art depend on noise moments and vanish as $p \rightarrow 1$, our exponents are constant and strictly better whenever $p < 6/5$ for non-convex and $p < 8/7$ for strongly convex costs. Experiments validate our theory, showing that clipping is not always the optimal nonlinearity, further underlining the value of a general framework. }

This paper proposes hyperboloid Gaussian process latent variable models (hGP-LVMs) to embed high-dimensional hierarchical data while preserving the implicit continuity via nonparametric estimation. We adopt generative modeling using the GP, which provides effective hierarchical embedding and executes ill-posed hyperparameter tuning. This paper presents three variants of the proposed models that employ original point, sparse point, and Bayesian estimations, and we establish their learning algorithms by incorporating the Riemannian optimization and active approximation scheme of the GP-LVM. In addition, we employ the reparameterization trick for scalable learning of the latent variables in the Bayesian estimation method. The proposed hGP-LVMs were applied to several datasets, and the results demonstrate their ability to represent high-dimensional hierarchies in low-dimensional spaces. }

In this work, we prove a theorem that places fundamental limits on this ``best of both worlds'' approach. Using the framework of impossible inference, we show that although it is possible to use experimental data to \emph{falsify} causal effect estimates from observational data, in general it is not possible to \emph{validate} such estimates. Our theorem proves that while experimental data can be used to detect bias in observational studies, without additional assumptions on the smoothness of the correction function, it can not be used to remove it. We provide a practical example of such an assumption, developing a novel Gaussian Process based approach to construct intervals which contain the true treatment effect with high probability, both inside and outside of the support of the experimental data.

More formally, we consider the problem of approximating the total variation distance between two multivariate Gaussians to within an $\epsilon$-relative error.  Previous works achieved a \emph{fixed} constant relative error approximation via closed-form formulas. In this work, we give algorithms that given any two $n$-dimensional Gaussians $D_1,D_2$, and any error bound $\epsilon > 0$, approximate the total variation distance $D := d_{TV}(D_1,D_2)$ to $\epsilon$-relative accuracy in $\mathrm{poly}(n,\frac{1}{\epsilon},\log \frac{1}{D})$ operations.

As a first step in this direction, we study a collective risk dilemma where agents dynamically decide whether to trust predictions based on past accuracy. As predictions shape collective outcomes, social welfare arises naturally as a metric of concern. We explore the resulting interplay between accuracy and welfare, and demonstrate that searching for stable accurate predictions can minimize social welfare with high probability in our setting.

    abstract = { In this paper, we introduce Partial Information Decomposition of Features (PIDF), a new paradigm for simultaneous data interpretability and feature selection. Contrary to traditional methods that assign a single importance value, our approach is based on three metrics per feature: the mutual information shared with the target variable, the feature's contribution to synergistic information, and the amount of this information that is redundant. In particular, we develop a novel procedure based on these three metrics, which reveals not only how features are correlated with the target but also the additional and overlapping information provided by considering them in combination with other features. We extensively evaluate PIDF using both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its potential applications and effectiveness, by considering case studies from genetics and neuroscience. }

Prior works have proposed deep neural networks (DNNs) for learning such a mapping, enabling the learning of solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, these works still struggle to learn dynamics that obeys the laws of physics. This paper proposes Energy-consistent Neural Operators (ENOs), a general framework for learning solution operators of PDEs that follows the energy conservation or dissipation law from observed solution trajectories. We introduce a novel penalty function inspired by the energy-based theory of physics for training, in which the functional derivative is calculated making full use of automatic differentiation, allowing one to bias the outputs of the DNN-based solution operators to obey appropriate energetic behavior without explicit PDEs. Experiments on multiple systems show that ENO outperforms existing DNN models in predicting solutions from data, especially in super-resolution settings. }

Here, we present BICauseTree: an interpretable balancing method that identifies clusters where natural experiments occur locally. Our approach builds on decision trees with a customized objective function to improve balancing and reduce treatment allocation bias. Consequently, it can additionally detect subgroups presenting positivity violations, exclude them, and provide a covariate-based definition of the target population we can infer from and generalize to. We evaluate the method's performance using synthetic and realistic datasets, explore its bias-interpretability tradeoff, and show that it is comparable with existing approaches. }

This method not only offers point estimates but also a predictive distribution for these quantities when labels are missing. We empirically show that the predictive distribution's location and shape are generally correct, even in the MNAR regime. Moreover, we establish that this distribution is approximately Gaussian and provide finite-sample convergence bounds. Additionally, a robustness proof is presented, confirming the validity of the approximation under a realistic error model. }

Inspired by advancements in discrete diffusion models for graph generation, we aim to design a diffusion-based method to address this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based G2G framework while retaining essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our key innovation involves a multi-stage diffusion process. We decompose the retrosynthesis procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products, then generate external bonds to connect products and generated groups. Interestingly, this generation process mirrors the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template retrosynthesis workflow, i.e., from reaction center identification to synthon completion. Based on these designs, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel diffusion-based method for the retrosynthesis task. Experimental results demonstrate that RetroDiff surpasses all semi-template methods in accuracy, and outperforms template-based and template-free methods in large-scale scenarios and molecular validity, respectively. }

We derive a lower bound on the minimax detectability threshold involving the relevant signal strength parameter and show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the changepoint consistently when the signal strength is above a small multiplicative factor times the minimax detectability threshold. We do not make any a priori assumption on the sparsity of the underlying networks and only require that the overall average degree goes to infinity. Via simulation experiments, we empirically show that the proposed algorithm works in regimes of signal strength where global network changepoint estimation algorithms that do not take into account the community structure, fail to estimate an existing changepoint correctly. Finally, we apply our algorithm to a series of networks constructed using roll call data from the US senate and obtain changepoint(s) which align with those reported in the political science literature regarding the phenomenon of increasing political polarization. }

Automatic subgoal generation (ASG) has recently emerged as a viable MARL approach inspired by utilizing subgoals in intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning. However, end-to-end learning of complex task planning from sparse rewards without prior knowledge, undoubtedly requires massive training samples. Moreover, the diversity-promoting nature of existing ASG methods can lead to the "over-representation" of subgoals, generating numerous spurious subgoals of limited relevance to the actual task reward and thus decreasing the sample efficiency of the algorithm. To address this problem and inspired by the disentangled representation learning, we propose a novel "disentangled" decision-making method, Semantically Aligned task decomposition in MARL (SAMA), that prompts pretrained language models with chain-of-thought that can suggest potential goals, provide suitable goal decomposition and subgoal allocation as well as self-reflection-based replanning. Additionally, SAMA incorporates language-grounded MARL to train each agent's subgoal-conditioned policy. SAMA demonstrates considerable advantages in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art ASG methods, as evidenced by its performance on two challenging sparse-reward tasks, Overcooked and MiniRTS.

As language models mimic the distribution of human text ever closer, this will limit our ability to build effective detection algorithms. To combat this, we introduce a method for detecting machine-generated text that is entirely agnostic of the generating language model. This is achieved by targeting a defect in the way that decoding strategies, such as temperature or top-k sampling, normalize conditional probability measures. This method can be rigorously theoretically justified, is easily explainable, and is conceptually distinct from existing methods for detecting machine-generated text. We evaluate our detector in the white and black box settings across various language models, datasets, and passage lengths. We also study the effect of paraphrasing attacks on our detector and the extent to which it is biased against non-native speakers. In each of these settings, the performance of our test is at least comparable to that of other state-of-the-art text detectors, and in some cases, we strongly outperform these baselines. }

However, the optimization of WMDS poses significant challenges due to the highly non-convex nature of its objective function. Stress Majorization, a method classified under the Majorization-Minimization algorithm, is among the most widely used solvers for this problem because it guarantees non-increasing loss values during optimization, even with a non-convex objective function. Despite this advantage, Stress Majorization suffers from high computational complexity, specifically $\mathcal{O}(\max(n^3, n^2 p))$ per iteration, where $n$ denotes the number of data points, and $p$ represents the projection dimension, rendering it impractical for large-scale data analysis. To mitigate the computational challenge, we introduce StableMDS, a novel gradient descent-based method that reduces the computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(n^2 p)$ per iteration. StableMDS achieves this computational efficiency by applying gradient descent independently to each point, thereby eliminating the need for costly matrix operations inherent in Stress Majorization. Furthermore, we theoretically ensure non-increasing loss values and optimization stability akin to Stress Majorization. These advancements not only enhance computational efficiency but also maintain stability, thereby broadening the applicability of WMDS to larger datasets. }

    Our first contribution is an output-sensitive mechanism in the insertions-only model ($\chi = \\{0,1\\}$) for maintaining (i) the histogram or (ii) queries that do not require maintaining the entire histogram, such as the maximum or minimum column sum, the median, or any quantiles.
    The mechanism has an additive error of $O(d\log^2 (dq^*)+\log T)$ whp, where $q^*$ is the maximum output value over all time steps on this dataset. The mechanism does not require $q^*$ as input. This breaks the $\Omega(d \log T)$ bound of prior work when $q^* \ll T$.
    
    Our second contribution is a mechanism for the turnstile model that admits negative entry updates ($\chi = \\{-1, 0,1\\}$). This mechanism has an additive error of $O(d \log^2 (dK) + \log T)$ whp, where $K$ is the number of times two consecutive data rows differ, and the mechanism does not require $K$ as input. This is useful when monitoring inputs that only vary under unusual circumstances. For $d=1$ this gives the first private mechanism with error $O(\log^2 K + \log T)$ for continual counting in the turnstile model, improving on the $O(\log^2 n + \log T)$ error bound by Dwork, Naor, Reingold, Rothblum (ASIACRYPT 2015), where $n$ is the number of ones in the stream, as well as allowing negative entries, while Dwork et al.\ (2015) can only handle nonnegative entries ($\chi=\\{0,1\\}$). }

While the latter assumes that the conditional distribution is piece wise constant, the framework we develop permits in contrast to deal with continuous conditional distributions, provided that they fulfill a H{\"o}lder smoothness constraint. We first show that a naive approach based on discretisation at a uniform level, fixed a priori and consisting in applying next the active strategy designed for the discrete setting generally fails. Instead, we propose a novel algorithm, referred to as smooth-rank and designed for the continuous setting, which aims to minimise the distance between the ROC curve of the estimated ranking rule and the optimal one w.r.t. the $\sup$ norm. We show that, for a fixed confidence level $\epsilon>0$ and probability $\delta\in (0,1)$, smooth-rank is PAC$(\epsilon,\delta)$. In addition, we provide a problem dependent upper bound on the expected sampling time of smooth-rank and establish a problem dependent lower bound on the expected sampling time of any PAC$(\epsilon,\delta)$ algorithm. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, numerical results are presented, providing solid empirical evidence of the performance of the algorithm proposed, which compares favorably with alternative approaches. }

In this paper, we revise the sample complexity of learning an optimal strategy to commit to in SGs. We provide a novel algorithm that (i) does not require any of the limiting assumptions made by state-of-the-art approaches and (ii) deals with a trade-off between sample complexity and termination probability arising when leader's strategies representation has finite precision. Such a trade-off has been completely neglected by existing algorithms and, if not properly managed, it may result in them using exponentially-many samples. Our algorithm requires novel techniques, which also pave the way to addressing learning problems in other models with commitment ubiquitous in the real world. }

We propose to build Bayesian approximations in this null space, thereby guaranteeing that the Bayesian predictive does not underfit. We suggest a matrix-free algorithm for projecting onto this null space, which scales linearly with the number of parameters and quadratically with the number of output dimensions. We further propose an approximation that only scales linearly with parameters to make the method applicable to generative models.

    abstract = { Recent progress in robust statistical learning has mainly tackled convex problems, like mean estimation or linear regression, with non-convex challenges receiving less attention. Phase retrieval exemplifies such a non-convex problem, requiring the recovery of a signal from only the magnitudes of its linear measurements, without phase (sign) information. While several non-convex methods, especially those involving the Wirtinger Flow algorithm, have been proposed for noiseless or mild noise settings, developing solutions for heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruption remains an open challenge. In this paper, we investigate an approach that leverages robust gradient descent techniques to improve the Wirtinger Flow algorithm's ability to simultaneously cope with fourth moment bounded noise and adversarial contamination in both the inputs (covariates) and outputs (responses). We address two scenarios: known zero-mean noise and completely unknown noise. For the latter, we propose a preprocessing step that alters the problem into a new format that does not fit traditional phase retrieval approaches but can still be resolved with a tailored version of the algorithm for the zero-mean noise context. }

    Based on a distribution-aware mean estimation algorithm, we establish an $M$-dependent upper bounds on the worst-case risk over $\mu$ for the task of mean estimation. We then derive a lower bound. The two bounds are asymptotically matching up to logarithmic factors and reduce to known bounds when $m_u = m$ for any user $u$. }

    abstract = { Gaussian processes are notorious for scaling cubically with the size of the training set, preventing application to very large regression problems. Computation-aware Gaussian processes (CAGPs) tackle this scaling issue by exploiting probabilistic linear solvers to reduce complexity, widening the posterior with additional \emph{computational} uncertainty due to reduced computation. However, the most commonly used CAGP framework results in (sometimes dramatically) conservative uncertainty quantification, making the posterior difficult to use in practice. In this work, we prove that if the utilised probabilistic linear solver is \emph{calibrated}, in a rigorous statistical sense, then so too is the induced CAGP. We thus propose a new CAGP framework, CAGP-GS, based on using Gauss-Seidel iterations for the underlying probabilistic linear solver. CAGP-GS performs favourably compared to existing approaches when the test set is low-dimensional and few iterations are performed. We test the calibratedness on a synthetic problem, and compare the performance to existing approaches on a large-scale global temperature regression problem. }

To this end, we propose a novel method for fair graph learning without demographic information. Our approach leverages a Bayesian variational autoencoder to infer missing demographic information and uses disentangled latent variables to separately capture demographics-related and label-related information, reducing interference when inferring demographic proxies. Additionally, we incorporate a fairness regularizer that enables measuring model fairness without demographics while optimizing the fairness objective. Extensive experiments on three real-world graph datasets demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in improving both fairness and utility. }

We extend the algorithmic stability framework to gradient-based interpretation maps and prove bounds on the stability error of standard Simple-Grad, Integrated-Gradients, and Smooth-Grad saliency maps. Our theoretical results suggest the role of Gaussian smoothing in boosting the stability of gradient-based maps to the randomness of training settings. On the other hand, we analyze the faithfulness of the Smooth-Grad maps to the original Simple-Grad and show the lower fidelity under a more intense Gaussian smoothing. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments on standard image datasets. Our empirical results confirm our hypothesis on the fidelity-stability trade-off in the application of Gaussian smoothing to gradient-based interpretation maps. }

In commonly used feature importance scores, these cooperative effects are conflated with the features' individual contributions, making them prone to misinterpretations. 
    In this work, we derive DIP, a new mathematical decomposition of individual feature importance scores that disentangles three components: the standalone contribution and the contributions stemming from interactions and dependencies.

We link the potential outcomes framework for causal inference with deferring systems, which allows to identify the causal impact of the deferring strategy on predictive accuracy. We distinguish two scenarios. In the first one, we have access to both the human and ML model predictions for the deferred instances. Here, we can identify the individual causal effects for deferred instances and the aggregates of them. In the second one, only human predictions are available for the deferred instances. Here, we can resort to regression discontinuity design to estimate a local causal effect. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real datasets for seven deferring systems from the literature. }

    infinitely more parameters to converge to a
    GP, which is characterized by a fixed learning

But when does this useful relationship break down? In this work, we explore its robustness. The key observation is that noisy data and the presence of nuisance features can be sufficient to shatter the Accuracy-on-the-line phenomenon. In these cases, ID and OOD accuracy can become negatively correlated, leading to "Accuracy-on-the-wrong-line". This phenomenon can also occur in the presence of spurious (shortcut) features, which tend to overshadow the more complex signal (core, non-spurious) features, resulting in a large nuisance feature space. Moreover, scaling to larger datasets does not mitigate this undesirable behaviour and may even exacerbate it. We formally prove a lower bound on OOD error in a linear classification model, characterising the conditions on the noise and nuisance features for a large OOD error. We finally demonstrate this phenomenon across both synthetic and real datasets with noisy data and nuisance features. }

The estimators for the model parameters are proven to be consistent under general conditions. We also introduce a method to select the most discriminatory frequencies, and it possesses the sure screening property.  The novelty of our method lies in the interpretability of the parameters hence suitable for neuroscience where understanding differences in brain network connectivity across various states is crucial.

In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition more effectively compared to other strategies. }

    Existing approaches for identifying information shared among $d>3$ variables are frequently computationally intractable, asymmetric with respect to a target variable, or unable to account for all the ways in which the joint probability distribution can be factorised. Here we present a systematic framework based on lattice theory to derive higher-order information-theoretic measures for multivariate data. Our construction uses lattice and operator function pairs, whereby an operator function is applied over a lattice that represents the algebraic relationships among variables. We show that many commonly used measures can be derived within this framework, yet they fail to capture all interactions for $d>3$, either because they are defined on restricted sublattices, or because the use of the KL divergence as an operator function, a typical choice, leads to undesired disregard of groups of interactions. To fully characterise all interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg Information, which is defined over the full partition lattice and uses generalised divergences (beyond KL) as operator functions. We validate the Streitberg Information on synthetic data, and illustrate its application in detecting complex interactions among stocks, decoding neural signals, and performing feature selection in machine learning. }

However, because of oft-observed instabilities when implementing these RLHF pipelines, various reparameterization techniques have recently been introduced to sidestep the need for separately learning an RL reward model.  Instead, directly fine-tuning for human preferences is achieved via the minimization of a single closed-form training objective, a process originally referred to as direct preference optimization (DPO).  Although effective in certain real-world settings, we detail how the foundational role of DPO reparameterizations (and equivalency to applying RLHF with an optimal reward) may be obfuscated once inevitable optimization constraints are introduced during model training.  This then motivates alternative derivations and analysis of DPO that remain intact even in the presence of such constraints.  As initial steps in this direction, we re-derive DPO from a simple Gaussian estimation perspective, with strong ties to compressive sensing and classical constrained optimization problems involving noise-adaptive, concave regularization. }

In this work, we provide a random matrix analysis of how fully-connected two-layer neural networks adapt to the target function after a single, but aggressive, gradient descent step. We rigorously establish the equivalence between the updated features and an isotropic spiked random feature model, in the limit of large batch size. For the latter model, we derive a deterministic equivalent description of the feature empirical covariance matrix in terms of certain low-dimensional operators. This allows us to sharply characterize the impact of training in the asymptotic feature spectrum, and in particular, provides a theoretical grounding for how the tails of the feature spectrum modify with training. The deterministic equivalent further yields the exact asymptotic generalization error, shedding light on the mechanisms behind its improvement in the presence of feature learning. Our result goes beyond standard random matrix ensembles, and therefore we believe it is of independent technical interest. Different from previous work, our result holds in the challenging maximal learning rate regime, is fully rigorous and allows for finitely supported second layer initialization, which turns out to be crucial for studying the functional expressivity of the learned features. This provides a sharp description of the impact of feature learning in the generalization of two-layer neural networks, beyond the random features and lazy training regimes. }

Our proposed approach incorporates covariate information into pretrained forecasting models through modular blocks that inject past and future covariate information, without necessarily modifying the pretrained model in consideration. In order to evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark composed of 32 different synthetic datasets with varying dynamics to evaluate the effectivity of forecasting models with covariates.

We show that GAI can be efficiently solved by combining a reward-maximizing sampling algorithm with a novel nonparametric anytime-valid sequential test for labeling arm means.
    
    We begin by presenting the theoretical guarantees of our proposed sequential test. Under nonparametric assumptions, our test ensures strict error control and asymptotically achieves the minimax optimal e-power, a notion of power for anytime-valid tests. Building on this, we propose an algorithm for GAI by pairing regret-minimizing sampling schemes with our sequential test as a stopping criterion. We show that this approach achieves minimax optimal stopping times for labeling arms with means above a threshold, under an error probability constraint $\delta$. Our empirical results validate our approach beyond the minimax setting, reducing the expected number of samples for all stopping times by at least 50\% across both synthetic and real-world settings. }

    Let $P$ be a set of $n$  points in a metric space and $r_x$ be the distance between $x \in P$ and its $\lceil n/k \rceil$-th nearest neighbor. The problem asks to optimize the $k$-center objective under the constraint that, for every point $x$, there is a center within distance $r_x$. 
    We give bicriteria $(\beta,\gamma)$-approximation algorithms that compute clusterings such that every point $x \in P$ has a center within distance $\beta r_x$ and the clustering cost is at most $\gamma$ times the optimal cost.
    Our main contributions are a deterministic $O(n^2+ kn \log n)$

Despite the relative importance of this step, most algorithms employ sampling- or gradient-based methods, which do not provably converge to global optima. This work investigates mixed-integer programming (MIP) as a paradigm for \emph{global} acquisition function optimization. Specifically, our Piecewise-linear Kernel Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (PK-MIQP) formulation introduces a piecewise-linear approximation for Gaussian process kernels and admits a corresponding MIQP representation for acquisition functions. The proposed method is applicable to uncertainty-based acquisition functions for any stationary or dot-product kernel. We analyze the theoretical regret bounds of the proposed approximation, and empirically demonstrate the framework on synthetic functions, constrained benchmarks, and a hyperparameter tuning task. }

Typically, learners assume that there is a labeling mechanism that determines which positive labels are observed. A particularly challenging setting arises when the observed positive labels are a biased sample from the positive distribution. Current approaches either require estimating the propensity scores, which are the instance-specific probabilities that a positive example's label will be observed, or make overly restricting assumptions about the labeling mechanism. We make a novel assumption about the labeling mechanism which we show is more general than several commonly used existing ones. Moreover, the combination of our novel assumption and theoretical results from robust statistics can simplify the process of learning from biased PU data. Empirically, our approach offers superior predictive and run time performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. }

Existing methods that target learning an invariant (feature, structure)-label mapping often depend on oversimplified assumptions about the data generation process, which do not adequately reflect the actual dynamics of distribution shifts in graphs. In this paper, we introduce a more realistic graph data generation model using Structural Causal Models (SCMs), allowing us to redefine distribution shifts by pinpointing their origins within the generation process. Building on this, we propose a casual decoupling framework, DeCaf, that independently learns unbiased feature-label and structure-label mappings. We provide a detailed theoretical framework that shows how our approach can effectively mitigate the impact of various distribution shifts. We evaluate DeCaf across both real-world and synthetic datasets that demonstrate different patterns of shifts, confirming its efficacy in enhancing the generalizability of GNNs.

We adopt a fairness definition using the generalized Gini function instead of the traditional utilitarian (total-sum) objective. After introducing a general but computationally prohibitive solution scheme based on linear programming, we focus on the homogeneous case where all sub-MDPs are identical. For this case,  we show for the first time that the problem reduces to optimizing the utilitarian objective over the class of "permutation invariant" policies. This result is particularly useful as we can exploit efficient algorithms that optimizes the utilitarian objective such as Whittle index policies in restless bandits to solve the problem with this fairness objective. For more general settings, we introduce a count-proportion-based deep reinforcement learning approach. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with comprehensive experiments, confirming the effectiveness of our proposed method in achieving fairness. }

But in many cases the universe is too big for people to plausibly consider all options. In the choice literature, this issue has been addressed by supposing that individuals first sample a small consideration set and then choose among the considered items. However, inferring unobserved consideration sets (or item consideration probabilities) in this ``consider then choose'' setting poses significant challenges, because even simple models of consideration with strong independence assumptions are not identifiable, even if item utilities are known.
      We apply the consider-then-choose framework to top-$k$ rankings, where we assume rankings are constructed according to a Plackett-Luce model after sampling a consideration set.
      While item consideration probabilities remain non-identified in this setting, we prove that we can infer bounds on the relative values of consideration probabilities. 
      Additionally, given a condition on the expected consideration set size and known item utilities, we derive absolute upper and lower bounds on item consideration probabilities.
    We also provide algorithms to tighten those bounds on consideration probabilities by propagating inferred constraints.
      Thus, we show that we can learn useful information about consideration probabilities despite not being able to identify them precisely.
      We demonstrate our methods on a ranking dataset from a psychology experiment with two different ranking tasks (one with fixed consideration sets and one with unknown consideration sets).
      This combination of data allows us to estimate utilities and then learn about unknown consideration probabilities using our bounds. }

In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional diffusions coupled with high-capacity summary networks for amortized NPE. Conditional diffusions address many of the challenges faced by flow-based methods.  Our results show that, across a highly varied suite of benchmarking problems for NPE architectures, diffusions offer improved stability, superior accuracy, and faster training times, even with simpler, shallower models.

In particular, we consider matrix completion settings where the entries of the underlying matrix follow an latent non-linear factor model, with the non-linearity belonging to a H{\"o}lder function class that is less smooth than Lipschitz. Our results establish following favorable properties for a suitable two-sided NN: (1) The mean squared error (MSE) of NN adapts to the smoothness of the non-linearity, (2) under certain regularity conditions, the NN error rate matches the rate obtained by an oracle equipped with the knowledge of both the row and column latent factors, and finally (3) NN's MSE is non-trivial for a wide range of settings even when several matrix entries might be missing deterministically.

In this work, we quantify the excess risk (a.k.a. regret) incurred using approximate posterior probabilities in batch binary decision-making. We provide analytical expressions for miscalibration-induced regret ($R^{CL}$), as well as tight and informative upper and lower bounds on the regret of calibrated classifiers ($R^{GL}$). These expressions allow us to identify regimes where recalibration alone addresses most of the regret, and regimes where the regret is dominated by the grouping loss, which calls for post-training beyond recalibration. Crucially, both $R^{CL}$ and $R^{Gl}$ can be estimated in practice using a calibration curve and a recent grouping loss estimator. On NLP experiments, we show that these quantities identify when the expected gain of more advanced post-training is worth the operational cost. Finally, we highlight the potential of multicalibration approaches as efficient alternatives to costlier fine-tuning approaches. }

    abstract = { Recent empirical evidence indicates that many machine learning applications involve heavy-tailed gradient noise, which challenges the standard assumptions of bounded variance in stochastic optimization. Gradient clipping has emerged as a popular tool to handle this heavy-tailed noise, as it achieves good performance both theoretically and practically. 
    However, our current theoretical understanding of non-convex gradient clipping has three main shortcomings. First, the theory hinges on large, increasing clipping thresholds, which are in stark contrast to the small constant clipping thresholds employed in practice. Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge of problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. Lastly, even with this knowledge, current sample complexity upper bounds for the method are sub-optimal in nearly all parameters. 
    To address these issues and motivated by practical observations, we make the connection of gradient clipping to its close relative --- Normalized SGD (NSGD) --- and study its convergence properties.
    First, we establish a parameter-free sample complexity for NSGD of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point, only assuming a finite $p$-th central moment of the noise, $p\in(1,2]$. 
    Furthermore, we prove the tightness of this result, by providing a matching algorithm-specific lower bound. In the setting where all problem parameters are known, we show this complexity is improved to $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\right)$, matching the previously known lower bound for all first-order methods in all problem dependent parameters. 
    Finally, we establish high-probability convergence of NSGD with a mild logarithmic dependence on the failure probability. Our work complements the studies of gradient clipping under heavy-tailed noise, improving the sample complexities of existing algorithms and offering an alternative mechanism to achieve high-probability convergence. }

The celebrated Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm addresses this problem, and recent work has investigated finite-time convergence guarantees for this algorithm and variants thereof. However, these guarantees hinge on the reward observations being always generated from a well-behaved (e.g., sub-Gaussian) true reward distribution. Motivated by harsh, real-world environments where such an idealistic assumption may no longer hold, we revisit the policy evaluation problem from the perspective of \emph{adversarial robustness}. In particular, we consider a Huber-contaminated reward model where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt each reward sample with a small probability $\epsilon$. Under this observation model, we first show that the adversary can cause the vanilla TD algorithm to converge to any arbitrary value function. We then develop a novel algorithm called \emph{Robust-TD} and prove that its finite-time guarantees match that of vanilla TD with linear function approximation up to a small $O(\epsilon)$ term that captures the effect of corruption. We complement this result with a minimax lower bound, revealing that such an additive corruption-induced term is unavoidable. To our knowledge, these results are the first of their kind in the context of adversarial robustness of stochastic approximation schemes driven by Markov noise. The key new technical tool that enables our results is an analysis of the Median-of-Means estimator with corrupted, time-correlated data that might be of independent interest to the literature on robust statistics. }

However, we observe that transition matrices alone are not sufficiently expressive to accurately explain ViT models. In this paper, we define a theoretical approach to creating explanations for ViTs called InFlow. The framework models the  patch-to-patch information flow using a combination of transition matrices and patch embeddings. Moreover, we define an algebra for updating the transition matrices of series connected components, diverging paths, and converging paths in the ViT model. This algebra allows the InFlow framework to produce high quality attributions which explain ViT decision making. In experimental evaluation on ImageNet, with three models, InFlow outperforms six ViT attribution methods in the standard insertion, deletion, SIC and AIC metrics by up to 18\%.

The action representation learning module extracts discriminative embeddings of actions from limited observations, while the policy learning module leverages the learned action representations, along with augmented synthetic action representations, to learn a policy capable of handling tasks with unseen actions.

Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) first, we identify under which conditions a \textit{trivial subspace} can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha>0$; (ii) second, in the case where the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an {\it easy subspace} consisting of directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha>\alpha_c$. The critical threshold $\alpha_{c}$ marks the presence of a computational phase transition, in the sense that it is conjectured that no efficient iterative algorithm can succeed for $\alpha<\alpha_c$. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions -akin to the parity problem- $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where some directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. Our analytical approach is built on the optimality of approximate message-passing algorithms among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent. }

This advantage-preserving transformation of the MDP motivates a class of algorithms which we call \emph{Reward Balancing}, which solve MDPs by iterating through these transformations, until an approximately optimal policy can be trivially found.  We provide a convergence analysis of several algorithms in this class, in particular showing that for MDPs for unknown transition probabilities we can improve upon state-of-the-art sample complexity results. }

An IV must affect $Y$ exclusively through $X$ and be unconfounded with $Y$. We present a framework for relaxing these assumptions with tuneable and interpretable "budget constraints". Our algorithm returns a feasible set of causal effects that can be identified exactly given perfect knowledge of observable covariance statistics. This feasible set might contain disconnected sets of possible solutions for the causal effect. We discuss conditions under which this set is sharp, i.e., contains all and only effects consistent with the background assumptions and the joint distribution of observable variables. Our method applies to a wide class of semiparametric models, and we demonstrate how its ability to select specific subsets of instruments confers an advantage over convex relaxations in both linear and nonlinear settings. We adapt our algorithm to form confidence sets that are asymptotically valid under a common statistical assumption from the Mendelian randomization literature. An accompanying R package, budgetIVr, is available from CRAN. }

Existing methods quantify uncertainty at the last layer or other approximations of the network which may miss some sources of uncertainty in the model. To address this gap, we propose an uncertainty quantification method for large networks based on variation due to regularization. Essentially, predictions that are more (less) sensitive to the regularization of network parameters are less (more, respectively) certain. This principle can be implemented by deterministically tweaking the training loss during the fine-tuning phase and reflects confidence in the output as a function of all layers of the network. We show that regularization variation (RegVar) provides rigorous uncertainty estimates that, in the infinitesimal limit, exactly recover the Laplace approximation in Bayesian deep learning. We demonstrate its success in several deep learning architectures, showing it can scale tractably with the network size while maintaining or improving uncertainty quantification quality. Our experiments across multiple datasets show that RegVar not only identifies uncertain predictions effectively but also provides insights into the stability of learned representations. }

In this work, we propose algorithms that utilize the

Specifically, we introduce two novel algorithms: Restarted Weighted$\text{OFUL}^+$ and Restarted $\text{SAVE}^+$. These algorithms address cases where the variance information of the rewards is known and unknown, respectively. Notably, when the total variance $V_K$ is much smaller than $K$, our algorithms outperform previous state-of-the-art results on non-stationary stochastic linear bandits under different settings. Experimental evaluations further validate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms over existing works. }

A common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral densities across two conditions. Using an l1 penalty on the difference, consistency is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse.

    Exponential function based attention unit is a fundamental element in LLMs. Several previous works have studied the convergence of exponential regression and softmax regression.
    
    In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve a rescaled version of the slightly different formulation of the softmax regression problem that arises in attention mechanisms of large language models. Specifically, we consider minimizing the squared loss between a certain function, which can be either the exponential function, hyperbolic sine function, or hyperbolic cosine function, and its inner product with a target $n$-dimensional vector $b$, scaled by the normalization term. This ``rescaled softmax regression'' differs from classical softmax regression in the location of the normalization factor.
    
    The efficiency and generalizability of this framework to multiple hyperbolic functions make it relevant for optimizing attention mechanisms. The analysis also leads to a corollary bounding solution changes under small perturbations for in-context learning. Limitations and societal impact are discussed. }

This phenomenon has sparked significant attention due to both its theoretical interest and practical relevance in applications such as model merging. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of this phenomenon for two-layer ReLU networks under a teacher-student setup. We show that as the student network width $m$ increases,  the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation exhibits a double descent behavior. Particularly, when $m$ is sufficiently large, the barrier decreases to zero at a rate $O(m^{-1/2})$. Notably,  this rate does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and demonstrates how substantial permutation can reduce the LMC loss barrier. Moreover, we observe a sharp transition in the sparsity of GD/SGD solutions when increasing the learning rate and investigate how this sparsity preference affects the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation. Experiments on both synthetic and MNIST datasets corroborate our theoretical predictions and reveal a similar trend for more complex network architectures. }

The analysis problem consists of finding the coefficients for the closest barycenter in the Wasserstein-2 distance to a given measure. Under the weakest assumptions on the measures thus far in the literature, we compute the derivative of the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost.  We leverage this to establish a characterization of barycenters with respect to the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost as solutions that correspond to a fixed point of an average of the entropy-regularized displacement maps.  This characterization yields a finite-dimensional, convex, quadratic program for solving the analysis problem when the measure being analyzed is a barycenter with respect to the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost. We show that these coefficients, as well as the value of the barycenter functional, can be estimated from samples with dimension-independent rates of convergence, and that barycentric coefficients are stable with respect to perturbations in the Wasserstein-2 metric. We employ the barycentric coefficients as features for classification of corrupted point cloud data, and show that compared to neural network baselines, our approach is more efficient in small training data regimes. }

However, HMC still struggles to sample from hierarchical models that induce densities with multiscale geometry: a large step size is needed to efficiently explore low curvature regions while a small step size is needed to accurately explore high curvature regions. We introduce the delayed rejection generalized HMC (DR-G-HMC) sampler that overcomes this challenge by employing dynamic step size selection, inspired by differential equation solvers. In generalized HMC, each iteration does a single leapfrog step. DR-G-HMC sequentially makes proposals with geometrically decreasing step sizes upon rejection of earlier proposals. This simulates Hamiltonian dynamics that can adjust its step size along a (stochastic) Hamiltonian trajectory to deal with regions of high curvature. DR-G-HMC makes generalized HMC competitive by decreasing the number of rejections which otherwise cause inefficient backtracking and prevents directed movement. We present experiments to demonstrate that DR-G-HMC (1) correctly samples from multiscale densities, (2) makes generalized HMC methods competitive with the state of the art No-U-Turn sampler, and (3) is robust to tuning parameters. }

To do so, we analyze linear models to characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better results on multivariate forecasting problems. }

However, P2L comes with limitations, including computational overhead, reliance on consistent data, and restriction to non-Bayesian settings. In this work, we overcome these challenges in general settings and employ the corresponding results to show that classical Gaussian process (GP) training procedures can be interpreted as instantiations of P2L, thus inheriting tight, self-certified bounds. Three contributions underpin these conclusions. First, we introduce early stopping in P2L, equipping it with a tight generalisation bound to reduce training costs and address the non-consistent case. Second, we adapt P2L to the Bayesian setting and demonstrate its equivalence to posterior updating in a hierarchical model. Third, we show that greedy subset-of-data GPs are special P2L instantiations. Numerical evidence shows that the resulting P2L bounds we obtain compare favourably with the train-test and PAC-Bayes approaches on various real-world datasets. }

    abstract = { Multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) is a powerful approach that utilizes low-fidelity, cost-effective sources to expedite the exploration and exploitation of a high-fidelity objective function. Existing MFBO methods with theoretical foundations either lack justification for performance improvements over single-fidelity optimization or rely on strong assumptions about the relationships between fidelity sources to construct surrogate models and direct queries to low-fidelity sources. To mitigate the dependency on cross-fidelity assumptions while maintaining the advantages of low-fidelity queries, we introduce a random sampling and partition-based MFBO framework with deep kernel learning. This framework is robust to cross-fidelity model misspecification and explicitly illustrates the benefits of low-fidelity queries. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively manages complex cross-fidelity relationships and efficiently optimizes the target fidelity function. }

A state-of-the-art, black-box algorithm, known as MASTER, is considered, with a focus on identifying the conditions under which it can achieve its stated goals. Specifically, we prove that MASTER's non-stationarity detection mechanism is not triggered for practical choices of horizon, leading to performance akin to a random restarting algorithm. Moreover, we show that the regret bound for MASTER, while being order optimal, stays above the worst-case linear regret until unreasonably large values of the horizon. To validate these observations, MASTER is tested for the special case of piecewise stationary multi-armed bandits, along with methods that employ random restarting, and others that use quickest change detection to restart. A simple, order optimal random restarting algorithm, that has prior knowledge of the non-stationarity is proposed as a baseline. The behavior of the MASTER algorithm is validated in simulations, and it is shown that methods employing quickest change detection are more robust and consistently outperform MASTER and other random restarting approaches. }

The intuition behind such a criterion is that, the pretrained LLM has the prior knowledge about OOD data due to its large amount of training data, and once finetuned with the in-distribution data, the LLM has sufficient knowledge to distinguish their difference. Leveraging the power of LLMs, we show that, the likelihood ratio can serve as an effective OOD detection criterion. Moreover, we apply the proposed LLM-based likelihood ratio to detect OOD questions in question-answering (QA) systems, which can be used to improve the performance of specialized LLMs for general questions. Given that likelihood can be easily obtained by the loss functions within contemporary neural network frameworks, it is straightforward to implement this approach in practice with \textbf{three lines} of code. Since both the pretrained LLMs and its various finetuned models are widely available from online platforms such as Hugging Face, our proposed criterion can be effortlessly incorporated for OOD detection without the need for further training. We conduct comprehensive evaluation across on multiple settings, including far OOD, near OOD, spam detection, and QA scenarios, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

In this work, we introduce a notion of generalization gap in collaborative filtering and analyze this with respect to latent collaborative filtering models. We present a geometric upper bound that gives rise to loss functions, and a way to meaningfully utilize the geometry of the items to improve recommendations. We show how these losses can be minimized and gives the recipe to a new latent collaborative filtering algorithm, which we refer to as GeoCF, due to the geometric nature of our results. We then show experimentally that our proposed GeoCF algorithm can outperform other all existing methods on the Movielens20M and Netflix datasets, as well as two large-scale internal datasets.

Our algorithm applies the recently developed technique of running value iteration on a discounted-reward MDP approximation with clipping by the span. We prove that the value iteration procedure, even with the clipping operation, converges. Moreover, we show that the associated variance term due to random transitions can be bounded even under clipping. Combined with the weighted ridge regression-based parameter estimation scheme, this leads to the nearly minimax optimal regret guarantee. }

      Recently, there has been a surge of interest in probabilistic PDE solvers---Bayesian statistical models mostly based on Gaussian process (GP) priors which seamlessly combine empirical measurements and mechanistic knowledge.
      As such, they quantify uncertainties arising from e.g. noisy or missing data, unknown PDE parameters or discretization error by design.
      Prior work has established connections to classical PDE solvers and provided solid theoretical guarantees.
      However, scaling such methods to large-scale problems remains a fundamental challenge primarily due to dense covariance matrices.
      Our approach addresses the scalability issues by leveraging the Markov property of many commonly used GP priors.
      It has been shown that such priors are solutions to stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) which when discretized allow for highly efficient GP regression through sparse linear algebra.
      In this work, we show how to leverage this prior class to make probabilistic PDE solvers practical, even for large-scale nonlinear PDEs, through greatly accelerated inference mechanisms.
      Additionally, our approach also allows for flexible and physically meaningful priors beyond what can be modeled with covariance functions.
      Experiments confirm substantial speedups and accelerated convergence of our physics-informed priors in nonlinear settings. }

This limitation is critical as many real-world networks exhibit heterophily, and even highly homophilous graphs can contain local regions of strong heterophily. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable Laplacian Positional Encodings (LLPE), a new PE that leverages the full spectrum of the graph Laplacian, enabling them to capture graph structure on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs. Theoretically, we prove LLPE's ability to approximate a general class of graph distances and demonstrate its generalization properties. Empirically, our evaluation on 12 benchmarks demonstrates that LLPE improves accuracy across a variety of GNNs, including graph transformers, by up to 35\% and 14\% on synthetic and real-world graphs, respectively. Going forward, our work represents a significant step towards developing PEs that effectively capture complex structures in heterophilous graphs. }

Based on this insight, we propose dynamic homophily, a new measure of homophily that applies in the dynamic setting. This new measure correlates with GNN discriminative performance and sheds light on how to potentially design more powerful GNNs for dynamic graphs. Leveraging a variety of dynamic node classification datasets, we demonstrate that popular GNNs are not robust to low dynamic homophily.

We propose a decorrelation-based approach for causal graph learning on dependent binary data, where the local conditional distribution is defined by a latent utility model with dependent errors across units. We develop a pairwise maximum likelihood method to estimate the covariance matrix for the dependence among the units. Then, leveraging the estimated covariance matrix, we develop an EM-like iterative algorithm to generate and de-correlate samples of the latent utility variables, which serve as de-correlated data. Any standard causal discovery method can be applied on the de-correlated data to learn the underlying causal graph. We demonstrate that the proposed de-correlation approach significantly improves the accuracy in causal graph learning, through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. }

In recent literature, progress has been made on this very challenging problem but with either unsatisfactory assumptions such as the knowledge of a safe policy, or have high cumulative regret. We propose the Safe-PSRL (posterior sampling-based RL) algorithm that does not need such assumptions and yet performs very well, both in terms of theoretical regret bounds as well as empirically. The algorithm efficiently trades-off exploration and exploitation using posterior sampling-based exploration, and yet provably suffers only bounded constraint violation using carefully-crafted pessimism.

Traditionally, the noise process $(W_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is assumed to be independent and identically distributed, with a distribution that is either fully known or can be consistently estimated. However, the occurrence of distributional shifts, typical in engineering settings, necessitates the consideration of the robustness of the policy. This paper introduces a distributionally robust stochastic control paradigm that accommodates possibly adaptive adversarial perturbation to the noise distribution within a prescribed ambiguity set. We examine two adversary models: current-action-aware and current-action-unaware, leading to different dynamic programming equations. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal finite sample minimax rates for achieving uniform learning of the robust value function across continuum states under both adversary types, considering ambiguity sets defined by $f_k$-divergence and Wasserstein distance. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework across various real-world settings. }

Our approach tracks the trajectory of signal learning and noise memorization in GNNs, characterizing their post-training generalization. We reveal that GNNs significantly prioritize signal learning, thus enhancing the regime of {low test error} over MLPs by $D^{q-2}$ times, where $D$ denotes a node's expected degree and $q$ is the power of ReLU activation function with $q>2$.

A simple change to the implementation of the Gibbs sampler allow us to perform Bayesian inference on high-dimensional GLMs that are practically infeasible with traditional Gibbs sampler implementations. We empirically demonstrate a substantial increase in effective sample size per time when comparing our Gibbs algorithms to state-of-the-art HMC algorithms. While Gibbs is superior in terms of dimension scaling, neither Gibbs nor HMC dominate the other: we provide numerical and theoretical evidence that HMC retains an edge in certain circumstances thanks to its advantageous condition number scaling.

    We propose budget-aware optimistic and randomized exploration algorithms that achieve a regret of ${O}((\kappa+\frac{T\nu^*}{B})\sqrt{T}\log T),$ for any total budget $B=\Omega(\sqrt{T}).$
    The parameters $\kappa$ and $\frac{T\nu^*}{B}$ capture the effects of preference feedback and knapsack constraints, respectively. Our regret performance is near-optimal and matches the bound of LinCBwK under the mild condition $B=\Omega(\sqrt{T}).$ 
    To achieve these results, we view the process of budget consumption and stopping time as Markov processing and analyze it via the Lyapunov drift method, which is translated into the strong regret guarantee. 
    The experiments on synthetic PbLinCBwK and online content moderation setting further justify the theoretical results. }

Yet, most often, a probabilistic representation is considered for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, hence creating challenges in applications where decoupling these two types of uncertainty is necessary. In this work, we show that an alternative representation of epistemic uncertainty, based on possibility theory, maintains many of the convenient features of standard Bayesian inference while displaying specific behaviours and properties that closely match the ones of an intuitive notion of information. Our main contributions are: i) a general framework for jointly representing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, ii) a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the analogue of Bayes' rule in possibility theory, iii) a version of the law of large numbers and of the central limit theorem for the associated variables, and iv) an analysis of the properties of the possibilistic maximum a posteriori. These results highlight that a dedicated and principled representation of epistemic uncertainty, that is compatible with standard Bayesian inference and preserves many of its strengths, is attainable. }

There has been a tremendous surge of research activities in building permutation invariant machine learning architectures. However, less attention is given to: (1) how to statistically test for the assumption of permutation invariance of coordinates in a random vector where the dimension is allowed to grow with the sample size; (2) how to estimate permutation invariant density functions; (3) how much ``smaller'' is the class of smooth functions with permutation invariance compared to that without permutation invariance. In this paper, we take a step back and examine these fundamental questions. In particular, our testing method is based on a sorting trick, and our estimation method is based on an averaging trick. These tricks substantially simplify the exploitation of permutation invariance. We also analyze the metric entropy of permutation invariant function classes and compare them with their counterparts without imposing permutation invariance. }

Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications. }

Specifically, we investigate the vector autoregressive model (VAR), a widely recognized model for time series data, where the transition matrix can be deconstructed into a combination of a sparse matrix and a low-rank one. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm tailored for estimating high-dimensional VAR models characterized by low-rank and sparse structures. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting informative observations from auxiliary datasets. Theoretical guarantees are established, encompassing model parameter consistency, informative set selection, and the asymptotic distribution of estimators under mild conditions.

DPRL ensures high-confidence improvement in densely visited states (called `decision points') while still utilizing data from sparsely visited states by using them for trajectory-based value estimates. By selectively limiting the state-actions where the policy deviates from the behavior, we achieve tighter theoretical guarantees that depend only on the counts of frequently observed state-action pairs rather than on state-action space size. Our empirical results confirm DPRL provides both safety and performance improvements across synthetic and real-world applications. }

We treat the user event history as the "treatment" for future events and the user category as the key confounder. Thus, the prediction problem can be framed as counterfactual outcome estimation, where each event is re-weighted by its inverse propensity score.

In this work, we formalize the credit assignment level as the number of agents cooperating to obtain a reward, and address scenarios with multiple coexisting levels.

Subsequently, we derive a diffusion process that obeys the aforementioned probability density at each time instant. Obtaining such a diffusion process involves solving certain Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs.

To address these issues, functional Bayesian inference has recently been proposed leveraging functional priors, such as the emerging functional variational inference. In addition to variational methods, stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is another scalable and effective inference method for BNNs to asymptotically generate samples from the true posterior by simulating continuous dynamics. However, existing MCMC methods perform solely in parameter space and inherit the unresolved prior issues, while extending these dynamics to function space is a non-trivial undertaking. In this paper, we introduce novel functional MCMC schemes, including stochastic gradient versions, based on newly designed diffusion dynamics that can incorporate more informative functional priors. Moreover, we prove that the stationary measure of these functional dynamics is the target posterior over functions. Our functional MCMC schemes demonstrate improved performance in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification on several tasks compared to naive parameter-space MCMC and functional variational inference. }

The proposed model encodes each element of a given tensor by considering information about other elements while reflecting the tensor structure via a self-attention mechanism. The missing values are predicted by tensor-specific linear projection from the encoded vectors. The proposed model is shared across different tensors, and it is meta-learned such that the expected tensor completion performance is improved using multiple tensors.

We do this in the context of two unsupervised learning tasks: personalized dimensionality reduction (ADEPT-PCA and ADEPT-AE) and personalized diffusion models (ADEPT-DGM). We develop convergence analyses for our adaptive algorithms which illustrate the dependence on problem parameters (e.g., heterogeneity, local sample size).

The current theoretical understanding of these methods, however, are limited and existing theoretical frameworks are not precise enough to characterize their performance in practice.  To this end, we derive new bounds based on optimal transport that analyze the UDA problem. Our new bound includes a term which we dub as entanglement, consisting of an expectation of Wasserstein distance between conditionals with respect to changing data distributions. Analysis of the entanglement term provides a novel perspective on the unoptimizable aspects of UDA. In various experiments with multiple models across several DS scenarios, we show that this term can be used to explain the varying performance of UDA algorithms. }

To overcome this limitation, we propose a method to obtain a parametric hypersurface representing the entire Pareto set instead of a finite set of points. Since the Pareto set of an $M$-objective optimization problem typically forms an $(M-1)$-dimensional simplex, we use a B{\'e}zier simplex as a model to express the Pareto set. We then develop a stochastic gradient descent-based algorithm that updates the B{\'e}zier simplex model toward the Pareto set, introducing a preconditioning matrix to enhance convergence.

HACSurv employs a flexible dependency structure using hierarchical Archimedean copulas to represent the relationships between competing risks and censoring. By capturing the dependencies between risks and censoring, HACSurv improves the accuracy of survival predictions and offers insights into risk interactions. Experiments on synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method can accurately identify the complex dependency structure and precisely predict survival distributions, whereas the compared methods exhibit significant deviations between their predictions and the true distributions.

    abstract = { Bayesian optimization (BO) is a leading method for optimizing expensive black-box optimization and has been successfully applied across various scenarios. However, BO suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it challenging to scale to high-dimensional problems. Existing work has adopted a variable selection strategy to select and optimize only a subset of variables iteratively. Although this approach can mitigate the high-dimensional challenge in BO, it still leads to sample inefficiency. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method that identifies important variables by estimating the length scales of Gaussian process kernels. Next, we construct an effective search region consisting of multiple subspaces and optimize the acquisition function within this region, focusing on only the important variables. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves cumulative regret with a sublinear growth rate in the worst case while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on high-dimensional synthetic functions and real-world problems show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. }

    abstract = { The introduction of the NOTEARS algorithm resulted in a wave of research on differentiable Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning. Differentiable DAG learning transforms the combinatorial problem of identifying the DAG underlying a Structural Causal Model (SCM) into a constrained continuous optimization problem. Being differentiable, these problems can be solved using gradient-based tools which allow integration into other differentiable objectives. However, in contrast to classical constrained-based algorithms, the identifiability properties of differentiable algorithms are poorly understood. We illustrate that even in the well-known Linear Non-Gaussian Additive Model (LiNGAM), the current state-of-the-art methods do not identify the true underlying DAG. To address the issue, we propose NOTIME  (\emph{Non-combinatorial Optimization of Trace exponential and Independence MEasures}), the first differentiable DAG learning algorithm with \emph{provable} identifiability guarantees under the LiNGAM by building on a measure of (joint) independence. With its identifiability guarantees, NOTIME remains invariant to normalization of the data on a population level, a property lacking in existing methods. NOTIME compares favourably against NOTEARS and other (scale-invariant) differentiable DAG learners, across different noise distributions and normalization procedures. Introducing the first identifiability guarantees to general LiNGAM is an important step towards practical adoption of differentiable DAG learners. }

Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging, for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain mass when unreliable modalities are detected.

Traditional combinatorial methods search DAG spaces to identify optimal structures, while recent advances in continuous optimization improve this search process. However, integrating structural constraints informed by prior knowledge into these methods remains a substantial challenge. Existing methods typically integrate prior knowledge in a hard way, demanding precise information about causal relationships and struggling with erroneous priors. Such rigidity can lead to significant inaccuracies, especially when the priors are flawed. 
    In response to these challenges, this work introduces the Edge Constraint Adaptive (ECA) method, a novel approach that softly represents the presence of edges, allowing for a differentiable representation of prior constraint loss. This soft integration can more flexibly adjust to both accurate and erroneous priors, enhancing both robustness and adaptability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages prior to improve causal structure accuracy while maintaining resilience against prior errors, thus offering significant advancements in the field of causal discovery. }

Recently, several works have investigated kernel models for self-supervised learning, hypothesizing that these also shed light on the behavior of wide neural networks by virtue of the NTK. However, it remains an open question to what extent this connection is mathematically sound --- it is a commonly encountered misbelief that the kernel behavior of wide neural networks emerges irrespective of the loss function it is trained on. In this paper, we bridge the gap between the NTK and self-supervised learning, focusing on two-layer neural networks trained under the Barlow Twins loss. We prove that the NTK of Barlow Twins indeed becomes constant as the width of the network approaches infinity. Our analysis technique is a bit different from previous works on the NTK and may be of independent interest. Overall, our work provides a first justification for the use of classic kernel theory to understand self-supervised learning of wide neural networks. Building on this result, we derive generalization error bounds for kernelized Barlow Twins and connect them to neural networks of finite width. }

We analyze this aspect, establishing the first such results for protein-ligand complexes. A plausible counterview may attribute the underperformance of these models to their excessive parameterizations, inducing expressivity at the expense of generalization. We investigate this possibility with a simple metric-aware approach that learns an economical surrogate for affinity to infer an unlabelled molecular graph and optimizes for labels conditioned on this graph and molecular properties. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results using 100x fewer trainable parameters and affords up to 1000x speedup.

We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d.~samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions.

By generating features in a data-driven manner, AFE enables the discovery of important features that may not be apparent through human experience or intuition. On the other hand, since AFE generates features based on data, there is a risk that these features may be overly adapted to the data, making it essential to assess their reliability appropriately. Unfortunately, because most AFE problems are formulated as combinatorial search problems and solved by heuristic algorithms, it has been challenging to theoretically quantify the reliability of generated features. To address this issue, we propose a new statistical test for generated features by AFE algorithms based on a framework called selective inference. As a proof of concept, we consider a simple class of tree search-based heuristic AFE algorithms, and consider the problem of testing the generated features when they are used in a linear model. The proposed test can quantify the statistical significance of the generated features in the form of $p$-values, enabling theoretically guaranteed control of the risk of false findings. }

Prior work (Mandal et al., 2023)  has addressed this problem under the tabular setting and established last-iterate convergence of repeated retraining with iteration complexity explicitly depending on the number of states. In this work, we generalize the results to \emph{linear Markov decision processes} which is the primary theoretical model of large-scale MDPs. The main challenge with linear MDP is that the regularized objective is no longer strongly convex and we want a bound that scales with the dimension of the features, rather than states which can be infinite. Our first result shows that repeatedly optimizing a regularized objective converges to a \emph{performatively stable policy}. In the absence of strong convexity, our analysis leverages a new recurrence relation that uses a specific linear combination of optimal dual solutions for proving convergence. We then tackle the finite sample setting where the learner has access to a set of trajectories drawn from the current policy. We consider a reparametrized version of the primal problem, and construct an empirical Lagrangian which is to be optimized from the samples. We show that, under a \emph{bounded coverage} condition, repeatedly solving a saddle point of this empirical Lagrangian converges to a performatively stable solution, and also construct a primal-dual algorithm that solves the empirical Lagrangian efficiently. Finally, we show several applications of the general framework of performative RL including multi-agent systems. }

We explore the setting where a 'batch' of $m$ independent such unlabeled examples is given, and the goal is to construct a batch prediction set with 1-$\alpha$ coverage. Unlike individual prediction sets, the batch prediction set is a collection of label vectors of size $m$, while the calibration sample consists of univariate labels. 
    A natural approach is to apply the Bonferroni correction, which concatenates individual prediction sets at level $1-\alpha/m$.  We propose a uniformly more powerful solution, based on specific combinations of conformal $p$-values that exploit the Simes inequality. We provide a general recipe for valid inference with any combinations of conformal $p$-values, and compare the performance of several useful choices.  Intuitively, the pooled evidence of relatively
     `easy' examples within the batch can help provide narrower batch prediction sets. Additionally, we introduce a more computationally intensive method that aggregates batch scores and can be even more powerful.    The theoretical guarantees are established when all examples are independent and identically distributed (iid), as well as more generally when iid is assumed only conditionally within each class. Notably, our results remain valid under label distribution shift, since the distribution of the labels need not be the same in the calibration sample and in the new batch.

We address these deficiencies by introducing a novel training regime for the energy function through distillation of pre-trained diffusion models, resembling a Helmholtz decomposition of the score vector field.

    However, another important aspect of model training --- identifying optimal feature hyperparameters --- has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach.
    In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method.

Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying significance of different features in the data, and existing supervised ground metric learning methods often fail to generalize across multiple classes or are limited to distributions with shared supports.   To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points (samples) like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The resulting learned global ground metric enables more accurate OT distances, which can significantly improve clustering and classification tasks.

    abstract = { The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same.
    
    Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use Inverse of  Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse of convolution layer, resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models. }

    abstract = { In voxel-based neuroimaging disease prediction, it was recently found that in addition to lesion features, there exists another type of feature called "Procedural Bias", which is introduced during preprocessing and can further improve the prediction power. However, traditional sparse learning methods fail to simultaneously capture both types of features due to their heterogeneity in sparsity types. Specifically, the lesion features are spatially coherent and suffer from volumetric degeneration, while the procedural bias refers to enlarged voxels that are dispersedly distributed. In this paper, we propose a new method based on differential inclusion, which generates a sparse regularized solution path on multiple parameters that are enforced with heterogeneous sparsity to capture lesion features and the procedural bias separately. Specifically, we employ Total Variation with a non-negative constraint for the parameter associated with degenerated and spatially coherent lesions; on the other hand, we impose $\ell_1$ sparsity with a non-positive constraint on the parameter related to enlarged and scatterly distributed procedural bias. We theoretically show that our method enjoys model selection consistency and $\ell_2$ consistency in estimation. The utility of our method is demonstrated by improved prediction power and interpretability in the early prediction of Alzheimer's Disease. }

The agent interacts with an environment during $T$ episodes, each of which consists of $H$ stages, and each episode is evaluated with respect to a reward function that will be revealed only at the end of the episode. We propose an algorithm, called APO-MVP, that achieves a regret bound of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(H)\sqrt{SAT})$, where $S$ and $A$ are sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively. This result improves upon the best-known regret bound by a factor of $\sqrt{S}$, bridging the gap between adversarial and stochastic MDPs, and matching the minimax lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$ as far as the dependencies in $S,A,T$ are concerned. The proposed algorithm and analysis completely avoid the typical tool given by occupancy measures; instead, it performs policy optimization based only on dynamic programming and on a black-box online linear optimization strategy run over estimated advantage functions, making it easy to implement. The analysis leverages two recent techniques: policy optimization based on online linear optimization strategies (Jonckheere et al., 2023) and a refined martingale analysis of the impact on values of estimating transitions kernels (Zhang et al., 2023). }

The core innovation of HPEC lies in utilizing angular relationships, rather than traditional distance metrics, to more effectively capture the similarity between data representations and their corresponding prototypes. This is achieved by leveraging hyperbolic entailment cones, a mathematical construct particularly suited for embedding hierarchical structures in the Poincare' Ball, along with a novel Backclip mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances performance in high-dimensional embedding spaces.

The proposed APO framework leverages insights from the lazy behaviour observed in over-parameterised neural networks, where only a small subset of parameters undergo any substantial updates during training. APO dynamically identifies and updates task-specific parameters while treating parameters associated with other tasks as protected, limiting their modification to prevent interference. The remaining unassigned parameters remain unchanged, embodying the lazy training phenomenon. This dynamic management of task-specific, protected, and unclaimed parameters across tasks enables effective information sharing, preserves task-specific adaptability, and mitigates gradient conflicts without enforcing a uniform representation. Experimental results across diverse healthcare datasets demonstrate that APO surpasses traditional information-sharing approaches, such as multi-task learning and model-agnostic meta-learning, in improving task performance. }

We formulate the problem as a Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation problem with structural penalties and propose a novel algorithmic framework called NetGGM. Unlike existing methods that rely on a central coordinator, NetGGM operates in a fully decentralized manner with low computational complexity. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that NetGGM converges linearly to the global optimum while ensuring consensus among agents. Numerical experiments validate its convergence properties and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in precision matrix estimation. }

To maintain privacy, such data is often only publicly available as summary statistics, and often studies for the endogenous covariates and the outcome are available separately. This has necessitated methods tailored to two-sample summary statistics. Current state-of-the-art methods modify linear instrumental variable (IV) regression---with genetic variants as instruments---to account for unmeasured confounding. However, since the endogenous covariates can be high dimensional, standard IV assumptions are generally insufficient to identify all causal effects simultaneously. We ensure identifiability by assuming the causal effects are sparse and propose a sparse causal effect two-sample IV estimator, spaceTSIV, adapting the spaceIV estimator by Pfister and Peters (2022) for two-sample summary statistics. We provide two methods, based on L0- and L1-penalization, respectively. We prove identifiability of the sparse causal effects in the two-sample setting and consistency of spaceTSIV. The performance of spaceTSIV is compared with existing two-sample IV methods in simulations.

We propose an alternative solution, the deep Vecchia ensemble (DVE), which allows deterministic UQ to work in the presence of feature collapse, negating the need for network retraining. DVE comprises an ensemble of GPs built on hidden-layer outputs of a DNN, achieving scalability via Vecchia approximations that leverage nearest-neighbor conditional independence. DVE is compatible with pretrained networks and incurs low computational overhead. We demonstrate DVE's utility on several datasets and carry out experiments to understand the inner workings of the proposed method. }

The proposed distances have low polynomial time complexity and are applicable to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as well as to maximal ancestral graph (MAGs) that may contain bidirected edges.

Besides traditional methods that operate in the time domain, many recent models transform time series data into the frequency domain to better capture complex patterns. However, these methods often use filtering techniques to remove certain frequency signals as noise, which may unintentionally discard important information and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose the Frequency Decomposition Mixture-of-Experts (FreqMoE) model, which dynamically decomposes time series data into frequency bands, each processed by a specialized expert. A gating mechanism adjusts the importance of each output of expert based on frequency characteristics, and the aggregated results are fed into a prediction module that iteratively refines the forecast using residual connections. Our experiments demonstrate that FreqMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving the best performance on 51 out of 70 metrics across all tested datasets, while significantly reducing the number of required parameters to under 50k, providing notable efficiency advantages.

In practice, $\mathcal Q$ is not rich enough to contain $p$, and the approximation is misspecified even when it is a unique global minimizer of $\text{KL}(q||p)$. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of VI to these misspecifications when $p$ exhibits certain symmetries and $\mathcal Q$ is a location-scale family that shares these symmetries. We prove strong guarantees for VI not only under mild regularity conditions but also in the face of severe misspecifications. Namely, we show that (i) VI recovers the mean of $p$ when $p$ exhibits an even symmetry, and (ii) it recovers the correlation matrix of $p$ when in addition $p$ exhibits an elliptical symmetry. These guarantees hold for the mean even when $q$ is factorized and $p$ is not, and for the correlation matrix even when $q$ and $p$ behave differently in their tails. We analyze various regimes of Bayesian inference where these symmetries are useful idealizations, and we also investigate experimentally how VI behaves in their absence. }

In this work, we theoretically show that, compared to Stepwise ICL, the transformer gains better error correction ability and more accurate predictions if the reasoning from earlier steps (Coherent CoT) is integrated. Given that this coherent reasoning changes the behavior of the transformer, we further investigate the sensitivity of the transformer with Coherent CoT when the demonstration examples are corrupted at the inference stage. Our theoretical results indicate that the transformer is more sensitive to errors in intermediate reasoning steps than the final outcome. Building upon this observation, we propose an improvement on CoT by incorporating both correct and incorrect reasoning paths in the demonstration.

A widely used variant of these problems relaxes the norm-bounding constraint through Lagrangian relaxation and moves it to the objective function as a form of penalty or regularization term. A challenging class of these models uses the zero-norm function to induce sparsity in statistical parameter estimation models. Most existing exact solution methods for these problems use additional binary variables together with artificial bounds on variables to formulate them as a mixed-integer program in a higher dimension, which is then solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Other exact methods utilize specific structural properties of the objective function to solve certain variants of these problems, making them non-generalizable to other problems with different structures. An alternative approach employs nonconvex penalties with desirable statistical properties, which are solved using heuristic or local methods due to the structural complexity of those terms. In this paper, we develop a novel graph-based method to globally solve optimization problems that contain a generalization of norm-bounding constraints. This includes standard $\ell_p$-norms for $p \in [0, \infty)$ as well as nonconvex penalty terms, such as SCAD and MCP, as special cases. Our method uses decision diagrams to build strong convex relaxations for these constraints in the original space of variables without the need to introduce additional auxiliary variables or impose artificial variable bounds. We show that the resulting convexification method, when incorporated into a spatial branch-and-cut framework, converges to the global optimal value of the problem. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, we conduct preliminary computational experiments on benchmark sparse linear regression problems with challenging nonconvex penalty terms that cannot be modeled or solved by existing global solvers. }

We propose a positive definite thresholding covariance estimation problem that includes nonconvex sparsity penalties and nonnegative correlation constraints. To address this problem, we introduce a multistage adaptive estimation algorithm based on majorization-minimization (MM). This algorithm progressively refines the estimates by solving a weighted $\ell_{1}$-regularized problem at each stage. Additionally, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis that characterizes the estimation error associated with the estimates generated by the MM algorithm. The analysis reveals that the error comprises two components: the optimization error and the statistical error. The optimization error decreases to zero at a linear rate, allowing the proposed estimator to eventually reach the oracle statistical rate under mild conditions. Furthermore, we explore various extensions based on the proposed estimation technique. Our theoretical findings are supported by extensive numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Further, we theoretically justify how the construction of TVineSynth ensures AIA privacy under a natural privacy measure for continuous sensitive attributes. When compared to competitor models, with and without DP, on simulated and on real-world data, TVineSynth achieves a superior privacy-utility balance. }

    abstract = { Fairness-aware classification models have gained increasing attention in recent years as concerns grow on discrimination against some demographic groups. Most existing models require full knowledge of the sensitive features, which can be impractical due to privacy, legal issues, and an individual's fear of discrimination. The key challenge we will address is the group dependency of the unavailability, e.g., people of some age range may be more reluctant to reveal their age. Our solution augments general fairness risks with probabilistic imputations of the sensitive features, while jointly learning the group-conditionally missing probabilities in a variational auto-encoder. Our model is demonstrated effective on both image and tabular datasets, achieving an improved balance between accuracy and fairness. }

This provides simultaneous confidence process on $\Lambda^A_t$, $\Lambda^B_t$ and their difference $\Lambda^B_t-\Lambda^A_t$, allowing each arm of the experiment and the difference between them to be safely monitored throughout the experiment. We extend our results by constructing a closed-form $e$-process for testing the equality of rates with a time-uniform Type-I error guarantee at a nominal $\alpha$. We characterize the asymptotic growth rate of the proposed $e$-process under the alternative and show that it has power 1 when the average rates of the two process differ in the limit. }

We complement existing sufficient conditions for constructing SPDMs by proving complementary necessary ones. Additionally, we propose a new framework that considers the geometric structures affecting the diffusion process. Leveraging this framework, we design a structure-preserving bridge model that maintains alignment between the model's endpoint couplings. Empirical evaluations on equivariant diffusion models demonstrate their effectiveness in learning symmetric distributions and modeling transitions between them. Experiments on real-world medical images confirm that our models preserve equivariance while maintaining high sample quality. We also showcase the practical utility of our framework by implementing an equivariant denoising diffusion bridge model, which achieves reliable equivariant image noise reduction and style transfer, irrespective of prior knowledge of image orientation. }

The latter feature incurs several methodological challenges, for which workarounds are proposed in this paper. In particular, it is shown that a representer theorem can be obtained for approximated versions of the log-likelihood and the least-squares criteria. Based on it, we propose an estimation method, that relies on two common approximations (of the ReLU function and of the integral operator). We provide a bound that controls the impact of these approximations. Numerical results on synthetic data confirm this fact as well as the good asymptotic behavior of the proposed estimator. It also shows that our method achieves a better performance compared to related nonparametric estimation techniques and suits neuronal applications. }

To this end, we employ the LB-SGD algorithm proposed in (Usmanova

Under the commonly assumed conditions of relaxed Fisher non-degeneracy and bounded transfer error in policy parameterization, we establish the theoretical properties of the LB-SGD algorithm. In particular, unlike existing CMDP approaches that ensure policy feasibility only upon convergence, the LB-SGD algorithm guarantees feasibility throughout the learning process and converges to the $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\varepsilon^{-6})$. Compared to the state-of-the-art policy gradient-based algorithm, C-NPG-PDA, the LB-SGD algorithm requires an additional $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples to ensure policy feasibility during learning with the same Fisher non-degenerate parameterization. }

In this work, we consider RL models that may actively acquire features from the environment to improve the decision quality and certainty, while automatically balancing the cost of feature acquisition process and the reward of task decision process. We propose the Active-Acquisition POMDP and identify two types of the acquisition process for different application domains. In order to assist the agent in the actively-acquired partially-observed environment and alleviate the exploration-exploitation dilemma, we develop a model-based approach, where a deep generative model is utilized to capture the dependencies of the features and impute the unobserved features. The imputations essentially represent the beliefs of the agent. Equipped with the dynamics model, we develop hierarchical RL algorithms to resolve both types of the AA-POMDPs. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves considerably better performance than existing POMDP-RL solutions. }

In this work we initiate the study of a generalized model of group testing that accommodates the physical effects of dilution of infected samples in large pools. In this model the binary test outcome is $1$ with probability $f(\rho)$, where $\rho$ is the density of the defectives in the test, and $f:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$ is a given  "test function" that models this dilution process. For a large class of test functions our results establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds, by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the number of tests necessary to recover the set of defective items, and providing computationally efficient algorithms with sample complexities that match these lower bounds up to constant or logarithmic factors. Furthermore, using tools from real analysis, we extend our results to any "sufficiently well-behaved function" $f:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$. }

We show that the resulting simple algorithm satisfies strong computational and sample complexity guarantees, achieved under the least restrictive data coverage assumptions known in the literature. In particular, we show that the sample complexity of our method scales optimally with the desired accuracy level and depends on a weak notion of coverage that only requires the empirical feature covariance matrix to cover a single direction in the feature space (as opposed to covering a full subspace). Additionally, our method can be implemented efficiently without requiring any computational oracles, and requires no prior knowledge of the coverage ratio (or even an upper bound on it), which altogether make it the strongest known algorithm for this setting to date. }

Our analysis focuses on discrete data distributions, allowing us to cast the adversarial risk minimization problems within the well-established framework of set packing problems. By doing so, we are able to identify three structural conditions on the support of the data distribution that are necessary for randomization to improve robustness. Furthermore, we are able to construct several data distributions where (contrarily to binary classification) switching from a deterministic to a randomized solution significantly reduces the optimal adversarial risk. These findings highlight the crucial role randomization can play in enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks in multiclass classification. }

A prevailing line of research exploits multiple environments, which assume how data distributions change, including single-node interventions, coupled interventions, or hard interventions, or parametric constraints on the mixing function or the latent causal model, such as linearity. Despite the novelty and elegance of the results, they are often violated in real problems. Accordingly, we formalize a set of desiderata for causal representation learning that applies to a broader class of environments, referred to as general environments. Interestingly, we show that one can fully recover the latent DAG and identify the latent variables up to minor indeterminacies under a nonparametric mixing function and nonlinear latent causal models, such as additive (Gaussian) noise models or heteroscedastic noise models, by properly leveraging sufficient change conditions on the causal mechanisms up to third-order derivatives. These represent, to our knowledge, the first results to fully recover the latent DAG from general environments under nonparametric mixing.

    abstract = { We consider the problem of causal effect estimation with an unobserved confounder, where we observe a single proxy variable that is associated with the confounder. Although it has been shown that the recovery of an average causal effect is impossible in general from a single proxy variable, we show that causal recovery is possible if the outcome is generated deterministically. This generalizes existing work on causal methods with a single proxy variable to the continuous treatment setting. We propose two kernel-based methods for this setting: the first based on the two-stage regression approach, and the second based on a maximum moment restriction approach. We prove that both approaches can consistently estimate the causal effect, and we empirically demonstrate that we can successfully recover the causal effect on challenging synthetic benchmarks. }

    abstract = { A key challenge in calibrating Multi-Label Classification(MLC) problems is to consider the interdependencies among labels. To address this, in this research we propose an unbiased, differentiable, trainable calibration error estimator for MLC problems by using Copula. Unlike other methods for calibrating MLC tasks that focus on marginal calibration, this novel estimator takes label interdependencies into account and enables us to tackle the strictest notion of calibration that is canonical calibration. To design the estimator, we begin by leveraging the kernel trick to construct a continuous distribution from the discrete label space. Then we take a semiparametric approach to construct the estimator where the marginals are modeled non-parametrically and the Copula is modeled parametrically. Theoretically we show that our estimator is unbiased and converges to true $L^p$ calibration error. We also use our estimator as a regularizer at the time of training and observe that it reduces calibration error on test datasets significantly. Experiments on a well established dataset endorses our claims. }

    abstract = { Change point detection in time series aims to identify moments when the probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many areas, such as human activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of multiple variables: If the distribution of any one variable changes, the entire time series undergoes a distribution shift. However, in practical applications, we may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their distributions while accounting for the presence of other components. Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation, we address this task by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods, and then employs conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution difference between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery method allows a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach. }

This confounding introduces heterogeneity in the predictor, i.e., $P(Y \mid X) = E_{P(Z \mid X)}[P(Y \mid X,Z)]$, making traditional covariate and label shift assumptions unsuitable. OOD generalization differs from traditional domain adaptation in that it does not assume access to the covariate distribution ($X^\text{te}$) of the test samples during training. These conditions create a challenging scenario for OOD robustness: (a) $Z^\text{tr}$ is an unobserved confounder during training, (b) $P^\text{te}(Z) \neq P^\text{tr}(Z)$, (c) $X^\text{te}$ is unavailable during training, and (d) the predictive distribution depends on $P^\text{te}(Z)$. While prior work has developed complex predictors requiring multiple additional variables for identifiability of the latent distribution, we explore a set of identifiability assumptions that yield a surprisingly simple predictor using only a single additional variable. Our approach demonstrates superior empirical performance on several benchmark tasks. }

In this work, we investigate {\it constant} stpesize schemes through the lens of Markov processes, proving that the iterates of both timescales converge to a unique joint stationary distribution in Wasserstein metric. We derive explicit geometric and non-asymptotic convergence rates, as well as the variance and bias introduced by constant stepsizes in the presence of Markovian noise. Specifically, with two constant stepsizes $\alpha < \beta$, we show that the biases scale linearly with both stepsizes as  $\Theta(\alpha)+\Theta(\beta)$ up to higher-order terms, while the variance of the slower iterate (resp., faster iterate) scales only with its own stepsize as $O(\alpha)$ (resp., $O(\beta)$). Unlike previous work, our results require no additional assumptions such as $\beta^2 \ll \alpha$ nor extra dependence on dimensions. These fine-grained characterizations allow tail-averaging and extrapolation techniques to reduce variance and bias, improving mean-squared error bound to $O(\beta^4 + \frac{1}{t})$ for both iterates. }

This work addresses these challenges from a perspective of Bayesian decision theory, starting from the assumption that our utility is characterized by a similarity measure that compares a generated response with a hypothetical true response. We discuss how this assumption enables principled quantification of the model's subjective uncertainty and its calibration. We further derive a measure for epistemic uncertainty, based on a missing data perspective and its characterization as an excess risk. The proposed methods can be applied to black-box language models. We illustrate the methods on question answering and machine translation tasks. Our experiments provide a principled evaluation of task-specific calibration, and demonstrate that epistemic uncertainty offers a promising deferral strategy for efficient data acquisition in in-context learning. }

The distribution correction estimation (DICE) family of estimators have advanced the state of the art in OPE by breaking the \emph{curse of horizon}. However, the major bottleneck of applying DICE estimators lies in the difficulty of solving the saddle-point optimization involved, especially with neural network implementations. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by establishing a \emph{linear representation} of value function and stationary distribution correction ratio, \emph{i.e.}, primal and dual variables in the DICE framework, using the spectral decomposition of the transition operator. Such primal-dual representation not only bypasses the non-convex non-concave optimization in vanilla DICE, therefore enabling an computational efficient algorithm, but also paves the way for more efficient utilization of historical data. We highlight that our algorithm, \textbf{SpectralDICE}, is the first to leverage the linear representation of primal-dual variables that is both computation and sample efficient, the performance of which is supported by a rigorous theoretical sample complexity guarantee and a thorough empirical evaluation on various benchmarks. }

So we can access data for any particular cell only at a single time point, but we have data across many cells. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr{\"o}dinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions in similar settings. However, existing methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic (often set to Brownian motion within SB). But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model class for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a class of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on simulated and real data. }

By leveraging minimal spanning trees in auxiliary graphs, RTD-Lite captures topological discrepancies with $O(n^2)$ time and memory complexity. This efficiency enables its application in tasks like dimensionality reduction and neural network training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that RTD-Lite effectively identifies topological differences while significantly reducing computation time compared to existing methods.

Our confidence bounds can be computed by solving a conic program, although this bare version quickly becomes impractical, because the number of variables grows with the sample size. However, we show that the dual of this conic program allows us to efficiently compute tight confidence bounds. We prove that our new confidence bounds are always tighter than existing ones in this setting. We apply our confidence bounds to kernel bandit problems, and we find that when our confidence bounds replace existing ones, the KernelUCB (GP-UCB) algorithm has better empirical performance, a matching worst-case performance guarantee and comparable computational cost. }

We propose a meta-algorithm that takes any network architecture and any Online Learner (OL) algorithm as input and produces a new algorithm which provably enhances the performance of the given OL under non-stationarity. Our algorithm is efficient (it requires maintaining only  $O(\log T)$ OL instances) and adaptive (it automatically chooses OL instances with the ideal "attention'' length at every timestamp). Experiments on various real-world datasets across text and image modalities show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of user specified OL algorithms for classification tasks. Key novel algorithmic ingredients include a multi-resolution instance design inspired by wavelet theory and a cross-validation-through-time technique. Both could be of independent interest. }

In this work, we propose instead to learn a small separate neural network predictor module on a collection of training questions, that take the hidden states from all the layers at the last temporal position as input and outputs predictions. In effect, such a framework disentangles the representational abilities of LLMs from their predictive abilities.

The introduced framework subsumes the various existing risk-sensitive models. An important and hitherto unknown observation is that for a wide range of riskmetrics, the optimal bandit policy involves selecting a \emph{mixture} of arms. This is in sharp contrast to the convention in the multi-arm bandit algorithms that there is generally a \emph{solitary} arm that maximizes the utility, whether purely reward-centric or risk-sensitive. This creates a major departure from the principles for designing bandit algorithms since there are uncountable mixture possibilities. The contributions of the paper are as follows: (i) it formalizes a general framework for risk-sensitive bandits, (ii) identifies standard risk-sensitive bandit models for which solitary arm selections is not optimal, (iii) and designs regret-efficient algorithms whose sampling strategies can accurately track optimal arm mixtures (when mixture is optimal) or the solitary arms (when solitary is optimal). The algorithms are shown to achieve a regret that scales according to $O((\log T/T )^{\nu})$,

In the few-shot case, wherein limited regression data is available, we propose a simple postprocessing algorithm which asymptotically recovers the ground-truth predictor. Our analysis leverages a fine-grained characterization of individual parameters arising from minimum-norm interpolation which may be of independent interest. Our results show that while minimum-norm interpolators for classification cannot transfer to regression a priori, they experience surprisingly structured attenuation which enables successful task shift with limited additional data. }

Recently, Vaswani et al.\ (2021) introduced a policy gradient method that corresponds to mirror ascent in the dual space of logits. We refine this algorithm, removing its need for a normalization across actions and analyze the resulting method (referred to as SPMA). For tabular MDPs, we prove that SPMA with a constant step-size matches the linear convergence of NPG and achieves a faster convergence than constant step-size (accelerated) softmax policy gradient. To handle large state-action spaces, we extend SPMA to use a log-linear policy parameterization. Unlike that for NPG, generalizing SPMA to the linear function approximation (FA) setting does not require compatible function approximation. Unlike MDPO, a practical generalization of NPG, SPMA with linear FA only requires solving convex softmax classification problems. We prove that SPMA achieves linear convergence to the neighbourhood of the optimal value function. We extend SPMA to handle non-linear FA and evaluate its empirical performance on the MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that SPMA consistently achieves similar or better performance compared to MDPO, PPO and TRPO. }

Unlike existing methods, which face important limitations like fixed resolution and scalability issues, SIGL learns a continuous graphon at arbitrary resolutions. GNNs are used to determine the correct node ordering, improving graph alignment. Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic consistency of our estimator, showing that more expressive INRs and GNNs lead to consistent estimators.

By integrating locality-sensitive hashing into Mamba blocks, we achieve significant improvements over traditional backbones in key HEP tasks, surpassing them in inference speed and physics metrics while reducing computational overhead. In key tests, our approach demonstrated promising results, presenting a viable alternative to traditional transformer backbones by significantly reducing FLOPS while maintaining robust performance. }

To address this, we propose a two-stage experiment that selects a sub-population in the first stage and restricts treatment rollout to this sub-population in the second stage. 
    We explore the role of clustering in the first stage by analyzing the bias and variance of a polynomial interpolation-style estimator under this experimental design. Bias increases with the number of edges cut in the clustering of the interference network, but variance depends on qualities of the clustering that relate to homophily and covariate balance. There is a tension between clustering objectives that minimize the number of cut edges versus those that maximize covariate balance across clusters. 
    Through simulations, we explore {a bias-variance} trade-off and compare the performance of the estimator under different clustering strategies. }

Our approach tightens the bounds of certified robustness, offering a more accurate reflection of model robustness in practice. Through rigorous experimentation we show that our method improves the robust accuracy, compressing the gap between empirical findings and previous theoretical results.
      We argue that investigating local Lipschitz constants and designing ad-hoc confidence intervals can further enhance the performance of randomized smoothing. These results pave the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between Lipschitz continuity and certified robustness. }

In contrast, we study the more manageable expectation-extended statistical distances and provide a novel theoretical justification on their validity for learning the return distribution. Based on this attractive property, we propose a new method called Energy Bellman Residual Minimizer (EBRM) for distributional OPE. We provide corresponding in-depth theoretical analyses. We establish a finite-sample error bound for the EBRM estimator under the realizability assumption.

The latter phenomenon called ``agreement-on-the-line'' enables precise unlabeled OOD performance estimation of models. In this work, we discover that agreement-on-the-line emerges even in linear classifiers over Gaussian class conditional distributions. We provide theoretical guarantees for this phenomenon in classifiers optimized via randomly initialized gradient descent, approximated by linear interpolations between random vectors and the Bayes-optimal classifier.

Real-world experiments on CIFAR10C shifts, validate our findings and the broader relevance of our theoretical framework. }

Essentially, score distillation updates 3D parameters by lifting and back-propagating scores averaged over different views. In this paper, we reveal that the gradient estimation in score distillation is inherent to high variance. Through the lens of variance reduction, the effectiveness of SDS and VSD can be interpreted as applications of various control variates to the Monte Carlo estimator of the distilled score. Motivated by this rethinking and based on Stein's identity, we propose a more general solution to reduce variance for score distillation, termed \emph{Stein Score Distillation (SSD)}. SSD incorporates control variates constructed by Stein identity, allowing for arbitrary baseline functions. This enables us to include flexible guidance priors and network architectures to explicitly optimize for variance reduction. In our experiments, the overall pipeline, dubbed \emph{SteinDreamer}, is implemented by instantiating the control variate with a monocular depth estimator. The results show that SSD can effectively reduce the distillation variance and consistently improve visual quality for both object- and scene-level generation. }

We study the hyperparameter tuning problem in the proportional high dimensional regime where both the sample size $n$ and number of features $p$ are large, and $n/p$ and the signal-to-noise ratio (per observation) remain finite. To achieve this goal, we first provide finite-sample upper bounds on the expected squared error of leave-one-out cross-validation (LO) in estimating the out-of-sample risk.

We give a proof for the convergence in smoothed KL divergence whenever the noise variance $\Delta$ is below $\Delta_{\rm AMP}$, which is the computation threshold for mean estimation introduced in (Barbier et al., 2020). We also show convergence in the Wasserstein distance under the same threshold assuming a dimension-free bound on the operator norm of the posterior covariance matrix, a condition strongly suggested by recent breakthroughs on operator norm bounds in similar replica symmetric systems. A key observation in our analysis is that phase transition does not occur along the sampling and interpolation paths assuming $\Delta<\Delta_{\rm AMP}$. }

    abstract = { Classical evolutionary approaches for multiobjective optimization are quite accurate but incur a lot of queries to the objectives; this can be prohibitive when objectives are expensive oracles. A sample-efficient approach to solving multiobjective optimization is via Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and Bayesian optimization (BO). Multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) involves the construction of an acquisition function which is optimized to acquire new observation candidates sequentially. This ``inner'' optimization can be hard due to various reasons: acquisition functions being nonconvex, nondifferentiable and/or unavailable in analytical form; batch sampling usually exacerbates these problems and the success of MOBO heavily relies on this inner optimization. This, ultimately, affects their sample efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Thompson sampling (TS) based approach ($q\texttt{POTS}$). Whereas TS chooses candidates according to the probability that they are optimal, $q\texttt{POTS}$ chooses candidates according to the probability that they are Pareto optimal. Instead of a hard acquisition function optimization, $q\texttt{POTS}$ solves a cheap multiobjective optimization on the GP posteriors with evolutionary approaches. This way we get the best of both worlds: accuracy of evolutionary approaches and sample-efficiency of MOBO. New candidates are chosen on the posterior GP Pareto frontier according to a maximin distance criterion. $q\texttt{POTS}$ is endowed with theoretical guarantees, a natural exploration-exploitation trade-off, and superior empirical performance. }

We characterize the properties of BCDP and articulate its connections with  standard non-Bayesian privacy frameworks. We further apply our BCDP framework to the problems of private mean estimation and ordinary least-squares regression.

However, most existing methods suffer from overfitting to fine-tuning data, yielding poor generalizability. To address this, we propose a new training objective function based on a Bayesian learning principle to balance adaptability and generalizability. We derive a prior over the logits, where the mean function is parameterized by the pre-trained model, while the posterior corresponds to the fine-tuned model. This objective establishes a balance by allowing the fine-tuned model to adapt to downstream tasks while remaining close to the pre-trained model. To avoid the overfitting issues of the standard softmax function, we adopt the one-vs-each softmax approximation along with its P\'olya-Gamma augmentation (OVE-PG). We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that using the Bayesian principle for prompt learning is indeed a sensible choice.

Compression methods such as quantization and sparsification can alleviate this issue. Still, their robustness to large and heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon sometimes observed in language modeling, remains poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by analyzing Distributed Compressed SGD (DCSGD) and Distributed SignSGD (DSignSGD) using stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our results show that DCSGD with unbiased compression is more vulnerable to noise in stochastic gradients, while DSignSGD remains robust, even under large and heavy-tailed noise. Additionally, we propose new scaling rules for hyperparameter tuning to mitigate performance degradation due to compression. These findings are empirically validated across multiple deep learning architectures and datasets, providing practical recommendations for distributed optimization. }

Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question---can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on \emph{each input token}? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a \emph{practical tool} for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods. }

    For each coordinate $i$, there exists a set $S_i\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $x_i=y_i$ if and only if $y_i\in S_i$. Otherwise, $x_i$ is missing and  takes a generic value (e.g ``?").

    - [\textbf{Linear thresholding}] An observation $\mathbf{x}$ is generated by first sampling $\mathbf{y}$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}^*, \Sigma)$ with unknown $\mathbf{\mu}^*$ and known $\Sigma$, and then applying the missingness model $\mathbb{S}$ where $\mathbb{S}(\mathbf{y}) = \{i \in [d]: \mathbf{v}_i^T \mathbf{y} \leq b_i\}$ for some $\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_d \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $b_1, \dots, b_d \in \mathbb{R}$. 
    We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm, assuming that none of the possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned on the values of the observed coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability. }

This allows us to obtain an asymptotic normality with nonparametric convergence rate while allowing for nonparametric or parametric estimation of the nuisance parameters. Subsequently, we derive an optimal bandwidth strategy along with a procedure to estimate asymptotic confidence intervals.

However, in practice, positive pairs are often generated using augmentations such as strong cropping to just a few pixels. Hence, a more realistic assumption is that all latent factors change with a continuum of variability across all factors. We introduce AnInfoNCE, a generalization of InfoNCE that can provably uncover the latent factors in this anisotropic setting, broadly generalizing previous identifiability results in CL. We validate our identifiability results in controlled experiments and show that AnInfoNCE increases the recovery of previously collapsed information in CIFAR10 and ImageNet, albeit at the cost of downstream accuracy.

Our work removes these limitations by proving convenient estimation guarantees for the transition model and introducing an optimistic algorithm that leverages the optimal class of deterministic belief-based policies.

Unlike existing estimation methods that are unable to use samples from different policies, we present a novel and simple estimator that overcomes this barrier. This new data-efficient technique, combined with the proposed $\textit{Action-wise OAS-UCRL}$ algorithm and a tighter theoretical analysis, leads to the first approach enjoying a regret guarantee of order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T})$ when compared against the optimal policy, thus improving over state of the art techniques.

We propose novel RL architectures using relaxed group and steerable convolutions and experiment on several continuous control domains and stock trading with real financial data. Our results demonstrate that the approximately equivariant network performs on par with exactly equivariant networks when exact symmetries are present, and outperforms them when the domains exhibit approximate symmetry.

Two concepts of fairness are important in FL: global and local fairness.  Global fairness addresses the disparity across the entire population and local fairness is concerned with the disparity within each client.  Prior fair FL frameworks have improved either global or local fairness without considering both.  Furthermore, while the majority of studies on fair FL focuses on binary settings, many real-world applications are multi-class problems. This paper proposes a framework that investigates  the minimum accuracy lost for enforcing a specified level of global and local fairness in  multi-class FL settings. Our framework leads to a simple post-processing algorithm that derives fair outcome predictors from the Bayesian optimal score functions.

    Specifically, the multi-index function we consider is a sum of neurons $f^*(x) = \sum_{j=1}^k \sigma^*(v_j^T x)$ where $v_1, ..., v_k$ are unit vectors, and $\sigma^*$ lacks the first and second Hermite polynomials in its Hermite expansion. 
    It is known that, for the single-index case ($k=1$), overcoming the search phase requires polynomial time complexity. 
    We first generalize this result to multi-index functions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions. 
    After the search phase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to the index vectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution.
    When the index vectors are orthogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove that neurons converge to the nearest index vectors. 
    Therefore, using $n \asymp k \log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with gradient flow with high probability over random initialization.
    When $v_i^T v_j = \beta \geq 0$ for all $i \neq j$, we prove the existence of a sharp threshold $\beta_c = c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes the average of the index vectors transitions from a saddle point to a minimum. 
      Numerical simulations show that using a correlation loss and a mild overparameterization suffices to learn all of the index vectors when they are nearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails when the dot product between the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold. }

We provide an oracle version for our algorithm characterized by an oracle variance upper bound $\sigma^2_t$ and a practical version with a novel estimation for this variance bound. Theoretically, we provide rigorous regret analysis for both versions and prove that our oracle algorithm achieves a better regret guarantee than other neural-UCB algorithms in the neural contextual bandits setting.

This naturally leads to a last-layer Bayesian neural network (BNN) architecture. The proposed method enjoys the interpretability of DKL as well as the computational advantages of BNN.

However, this neglects any epistemic model uncertainty. In contrast, \emph{Bayesian} causal inference does incorporate epistemic uncertainty into query estimates via Bayesian marginalisation (posterior averaging) over \emph{all} causal models. While principled, this marginalisation over entire causal models, i.e., both causal structures (graphs) and mechanisms, poses a tremendous computational challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by decomposing structure marginalisation into the marginalisation over (i) causal orders and (ii) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) given an order. We can marginalise the latter in closed form by limiting the number of parents per variable and utilising Gaussian Processes to model mechanisms. To marginalise over orders, we use a sampling-based approximation, for which we devise a novel auto-regressive distribution over causal orders (ARCO). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art in structure learning on simulated non-linear additive noise benchmarks, and yields competitive results on real-world data. Furthermore, we can accurately infer interventional distributions and average causal effects. }

In this paper, we consider the problem of linear submodular maximization under the bandit feedback in the pure-exploration setting, where the submodular objective function is defined as $f:2^U \rightarrow\mathbb{R}\_{\ge 0}$, where $f=\sum_{i=1}^dw_iF_{i}$. It is assumed that we have value oracle access to the functions $F_i$, but the coefficients $w_i$ are unknown, and $f$ can only be accessed via noisy queries. To harness the linear structure, 
    we develop algorithms inspired by adaptive allocation algorithms in the best-arm identification for the linear bandit, with approximation guarantees arbitrarily close to the setting where we have value oracle access to $f$.

However, it is common to have more than one possible prior for a given black-box function, for example suggested by domain experts with differing opinions. In some cases, the type-II maximum likelihood estimator for selecting prior enjoys the consistency guarantee, but it does not universally apply to all types of priors. If the problem is stationary, one could rely on the Regret Balancing scheme to conduct the optimisation, but in the case of time-varying problems, such a scheme cannot be used.  To address this gap in existing research, we propose a novel algorithm, PE-GP-UCB, which is capable of solving time-varying Bayesian optimisation problems even without the exact knowledge of the function's prior.  The algorithm relies on the fact that either the observed function values are consistent with some of the priors, in which case it is easy to reject the wrong priors, or the observations are consistent with all candidate priors, in which case it does not matter which prior our model relies on. We provide a regret bound on the proposed algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm on toy and real-world time-varying problems and show that it outperforms the maximum likelihood estimator, fully Bayesian treatment of unknown prior and Regret Balancing. }

Existing non-asymptotic methods are limited by poor empirical performance and exponential dependence on problem parameters.  In order to address these gaps, we propose and analyze the Clipped Second Moment Tracking (ClipSMT) algorithm, a variant of an existing algorithm with strong asymptotic optimality guarantees, and provide finite sample bounds on its Neyman regret. Our analysis shows that, in the superpopulation setting, ClipSMT achieves exponential improvements in Neyman regret on two fronts: improving the dependence on $T$ from $O(\sqrt{T})$ to $O(\log T)$, as well as reducing the exponential dependence on problem parameters to a polynomial dependence---although the setting we consider is slightly less general. We conclude with simulations which show the marked improvement of ClipSMT over existing approaches. }

These approaches model relationship categories as outcomes of a categorical distribution which is limiting and contrary to real-world systems, where relationship categories often intermingle and interact. In this work, we introduce a level of abstraction between the observable behavior of agents and the latent categories that determine their behavior. To do this, we learn a mapping from agent observations to agent preferences for a set of latent categories. The learned preferences and inter-agent proximity are integrated in a nonlinear opinion dynamics model, which allows us to naturally identify mutually exclusive categories, predict an agent's evolution in time, and control an agent's behavior. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the utility of our model for learning interpretable categories, and the efficacy of our model for long-horizon trajectory prediction. }

In practice, acquiring features, such as medical tests, can be both expensive and time-consuming, highlighting the need for strategies that select the most informative features for each individual, enhancing decision accuracy while controlling costs. Existing active feature acquisition (AFA) methods, developed for supervised learning, fail to address the unique challenges of CATE, such as confounding, overlap, and the structural similarities of potential outcomes under different treatments. To tackle these challenges, we propose specialised feature acquisition metrics and estimation strategies tailored to the CATE setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic datasets designed to reflect common biases and data issues. In doing so, this work aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge CATE estimation techniques and their practical, cost-efficient application in personalised treatment assignment. }

ScoreFusion is particularly useful for enhancing the generative modeling of a target population with limited observed data. Our starting point considers the family of KL barycenters of the auxiliary populations, which is proven to be an optimal parametric class in the KL sense, but difficult to learn. Nevertheless, by recasting the learning problem as score matching in denoising diffusion, we obtain a tractable way of computing the optimal KL barycenter weights. We prove a dimension-free sample complexity bound in total variation distance, provided that the auxiliary models are well-fitted for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. The sample efficiency of ScoreFusion is demonstrated by learning handwritten digits. We also provide a simple adaptation of a Stable Diffusion denoising pipeline that enables sampling from the KL barycenter of two auxiliary checkpoints; on a portrait generation task, our method produces faces that enhance population heterogeneity relative to the auxiliary distributions. }

First, we introduce generalization guarantees directly in terms of the LGGW under a flexible gradient domination condition. Second, we show that sample reuse in ERM does not make the empirical gradients deviate from the population gradients as long as the LGGW is small. Third, focusing on deep networks, we bound their single-sample LGGW in terms of the Gaussian width of the featurizer, i.e., the output of the last-but-one layer. To our knowledge, our generalization and optimization guarantees in terms of LGGW are the first results of its kind, and hold considerable promise towards quantitatively tight bounds for deep models. }

To address this, we introduce M$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models to capture expected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators of potential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly score through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically demonstrate that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and dependencies across sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms existing methods in extensive evaluations by 21\% on average, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale real-world case study on 130 assets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers.

For longer input prompt lengths, prefilling will incur a significant overhead on decoding time. In this work, we highlight the following pitfall of prefilling: for batches containing high-varying prompt lengths, significant computation is wasted by the standard practice of padding sequences to the maximum length. As LLMs increasingly support longer context lengths, potentially up to 10 million tokens, variations in prompt lengths within a batch become more pronounced. To address this, we propose prepacking, a simple yet effective method to optimize prefilling computation. To avoid redundant computation on pad tokens, prepacking combines prompts of varying lengths into a sequence and packs multiple sequences into a compact batch using a bin-packing algorithm. It then modifies the attention mask and positional encoding to compute multiple prefilled KV-caches for multiple prompts within a single sequence. On standard curated dataset containing prompts with varying lengths, we obtain a significant speed and memory efficiency improvements as compared to the default padding-based prefilling computation within Huggingface across a range of base model configurations and inference serving scenarios. }

In this work, we leverage stochastic rounding (SR) to address numerical errors of training with low-precision representation. We provide theoretical analyses of implicit regularization and convergence under the Adam optimizer when SR is utilized.

Empirical results from pre-training models with up to 6.7B parameters, for the first time, demonstrate that our BF16 with SR strategy outperforms (BF16, FP32) mixed precision strategies, achieving better validation perplexity, up to 1.54$\times$ higher throughput, and 30\% lower memory usage. }

PMM uses conjugate pairs of distributions to model complex data of various modalities like images and text, offering a flexible alternative to existing methods like diffusion models. PMM models iteratively refine noisy approximations of the target distribution using updates from online Bayesian inference. PMM is flexible because its mechanics are based on general Bayesian models. We demonstrate this flexibility by developing specialized examples: a generative PMM model of real-valued data using the Normal-Normal model, a generative PMM model of count data using a Gamma-Poisson model, and a generative PMM model of discrete data using a Dirichlet-Categorical model. For the Normal-Normal PMM model, we establish a direct connection to diffusion models by showing that its continuous-time formulation converges to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Additionally, for the Gamma-Poisson PMM, we derive a novel SDE driven by a Cox process, which is a significant departure from traditional Brownian motion-based generative models.  PMMs achieve performance that is competitive with generative models for language modeling and image generation. }

Unlike in online RL where the agent interacts with the environment while learning a policy, in the offline setting there cannot be such interactions in either the source tasks or the target task; thus multi-task offline RL can suffer from incomplete coverage.
    
    We propose an algorithm to compute pointwise uncertainty measures for the learnt representation in low-rank MDPs, and establish a data-dependent upper bound for the suboptimality of the learnt policy for the target task. Our algorithm leverages the collective exploration done by source tasks to mitigate poor coverage at some points by a few tasks, thus overcoming the limitation of needing uniformly good coverage for a meaningful transfer by existing offline algorithms. We complement our theoretical results with empirical evaluation on a rich-observation MDP which requires many samples for complete coverage. Our findings illustrate the benefits of penalizing and quantifying the uncertainty in the learnt representation. }

We aim to design algorithms that identify a near-optimal policy from the corrupted data, with provable guarantees. Existing theoretical works have separately studied the settings of corruption robust RL (learning from scalar rewards directly under corruption) and offline RLHF (learning from human feedback without corruption); however, they are inapplicable to our problem of dealing with corrupted data in offline RLHF setting. To this end, we design novel corruption robust offline RLHF methods under various assumptions on the coverage of the data-generating distributions. At a high level, our methodology robustifies an offline RLHF framework by first learning a reward model along with confidence sets and then learning a pessimistic optimal policy over the confidence set. Our key insight is that learning optimal policy can be done by leveraging an offline corruption-robust RL oracle in different ways (e.g., zero-order oracle or first-order oracle), depending on the data coverage assumptions. To our knowledge, ours is the first work that provides provable corruption robust offline RLHF methods. }

In practice, particularly when learning from human feedback in an online sense, adversaries can observe and react to the learning process and inject poisoned samples that optimize adversarial objectives better than when they are restricted to poisoning a static dataset once, before the learning algorithm is applied. Indeed, it has been shown in prior work that online dynamic adversaries can be significantly more powerful than static ones. We present a novel framework for computing certified bounds on the impact of dynamic poisoning, and use these certificates to design robust learning algorithms.

It refers to the model's ability to learn patterns on the fly from provided in-context examples in the prompt during inference. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Transformer architecture used in LLMs can implement a single-step gradient descent update by processing in-context examples in a single forward pass. Recent work has further shown that, during in-context learning, a looped Transformer can implement multi-step gradient descent updates in forward passes. However, their theoretical results require an exponential number of in-context examples, $n = \exp(\Omega(T))$, where $T$ is the number of loops or passes, to achieve a reasonably low error. In this paper, we study linear looped  Transformers in-context learning on linear vector generation tasks. We show that linear looped Transformers can implement multi-step gradient descent efficiently for in-context learning. Our results demonstrate that as long as the input data has a constant condition number, e.g., $n = O(d)$, the linear looped Transformers can achieve a small error by multi-step gradient descent during in-context learning. Furthermore, our preliminary experiments validate our theoretical analysis. Our findings reveal that the Transformer architecture possesses a stronger in-context learning capability than previously understood, offering new insights into the mechanisms behind LLMs and potentially guiding the better design of efficient inference algorithms for LLMs. }

Our approach embeds model structure and parameters into a more expressive feature representation, significantly improving  performance. Existing methods rely on standard thresholding, which often yields suboptimal results due to the non-convexity of the loss function. We introduce two methods to overcome discretization challenges: (1) an external oracle-based approach that infers uncertain variables using additional evidence from confidently predicted ones, and (2) a technique that identifies and selects the highest-scoring discrete solutions near the continuous output. Experimental results on various probabilistic models demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, highlighting its practical impact. }

This observation motivates our primary question: What are the information-theoretic limits of knowledge distillation? To this end, we leverage Partial Information Decomposition to quantify and explain the transferred knowledge and knowledge left to distill for a downstream task. We theoretically demonstrate that the task-relevant transferred knowledge is succinctly captured by the measure of redundant information about the task between the teacher and student. We propose a novel multi-level optimization to incorporate redundant information as a regularizer, leading to our framework of Redundant Information Distillation (RID). RID leads to more resilient and effective distillation under nuisance teachers as it succinctly quantifies task-relevant knowledge rather than simply aligning student and teacher representations. }

However, existing works mostly focus on specific pure exploration tasks, without a holistic view of the general pure exploration problem. This work fills this gap by introducing a versatile framework to study pure exploration, with a focus on identifying the pairwise relationships between targeted arm pairs. Moreover, unlike existing works that only optimize the stopping time (i.e., sample complexity), this work considers that arms are associated with potentially different costs and targets at optimizing the cumulative cost that occurred during learning. Under the general framework of pairwise pure exploration with arm-specific costs, a performance lower bound is derived. Then, a novel algorithm, termed CAET (Cost-Aware Pairwise Exploration Task), is proposed. CAET builds on the track-and-stop principle with a novel design to handle the arm-specific costs, which can potentially be zero and thus represent a very challenging case. Theoretical analyses prove that the performance of CAET approaches the lower bound asymptotically. Special cases are further discussed, including an extension to regret minimization, which is another major focus of MAB. The effectiveness and efficiency of CAET are also verified through experimental results under various settings. }

When using constant-step size SGD, the uniform error of our learned solution path relative to the true path exhibits linear convergence to a constant related to the expressiveness of the basis. When the true solution path lies in the span of the basis, this constant is zero. We also prove stronger results for special cases common in machine learning: When $\lambda \in [-1, 1]$ and the solution path is $\nu$-times differentiable, constant step-size SGD learns a path with $\epsilon$ uniform error after at most $O(\epsilon^{\frac{1}{1-\nu}} \log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, and when the solution path is analytic, it only requires $O\left(\log^2(1/\epsilon)\log\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$.  By comparison, the best-known discretization schemes in these settings require at least $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ discretization points (and even more gradient calls). Finally, we propose an adaptive variant of our method that sequentially adds basis functions and demonstrate strong numerical performance through experiments. }

Based on the connection, we establish a novel framework, \textbf{WIN} rate \textbf{D}ominance~(WIND), with a series of efficient algorithms for regularized win rate dominance optimization that approximates iterative BOND in the parameter space.

Then, we present CASTOR, a novel method that concurrently learns the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for each regime while determining the number of regimes and their sequential arrangement. CASTOR optimizes the data log-likelihood using an expectation-maximization algorithm, alternating between assigning regime indices (expectation step) and inferring causal relationships in each regime (maximization step). We establish the identifiability of the regimes and DAGs within our framework. Extensive experiments show that CASTOR consistently outperforms existing causal discovery models in detecting different regimes and learning their DAGs across various settings, including linear and nonlinear causal relationships, on both synthetic and real world datasets. }

Focusing on estimators based solely on neighborhood aggregation, we examine how two common convolutions---the original GCN and GraphSAGE convolutions---affect the learning error as a function of the neighborhood topology and the number of convolutional layers. We explicitly characterize the bias variance type trade-off incurred by GCNs as a function of the neighborhood size and identify specific graph topologies where convolution operators are less effective. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by synthetic experiments, and provide a start to a deeper quantitative understanding of convolutional effects in GCNs for offering rigorous guidelines for practitioners. }

While numerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited research has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given explicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that are unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose to perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To constrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the original optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data distribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability of the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For differentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative importance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal distribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world black-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization dataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art baselines. }

For small initialization, we theoretically show that GF converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with smaller initialization leading to lower final error. Our analysis shows that the final error is affected by the misalignment between the singular spaces of the pre-trained model and the target matrix, and reducing the initialization scale improves alignment. To address this misalignment, we propose a spectral initialization for LoRA in MF and theoretically prove that GF with small spectral initialization converges to the fine-tuning task with arbitrary precision. Numerical experiments from MF and image classification validate our findings. }

However, the lack of simulation-free properties inevitably results in high training costs and affects scalability. To obtain a trade-off between transport properties and scalability, we introduce variational Schr\"odinger momentum diffusion (VSMD), which employs linearized forward score functions (variational scores) to eliminate the dependence on simulated forward trajectories. Our approach leverages a multivariate diffusion process with adaptively transport-optimized variational scores. Additionally, we apply a critical-damping transform to stabilize training by removing the need for score estimations for both velocity and samples. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of samples generated with optimal variational scores and momentum diffusion. Empirical results demonstrate that VSMD efficiently generates anisotropic shapes while maintaining transport efficacy, outperforming overdamped alternatives, and avoiding complex denoising processes.  Our approach also scales effectively to real-world data, achieving competitive results in time series and image generation, both in unconditional and conditional settings. }

      A strength of the underlying signature features is that they provide a structured global description of a time series. However, this property can quickly become a curse when local information is essential and forgetting is required; so far this has only been addressed with ad-hoc methods such as slicing the time series into smaller segments.
      To overcome this, we propose a principled and data-driven approach by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism for signature features.
      This allows the model to dynamically adapt its observed context length to focus on more recent information. 
      To achieve this, we revisit the recently introduced Random Fourier Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF) with Gaussian processes (GPs).
      This results in a Bayesian time series forecasting algorithm with variational inference, that offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm that processes and transforms a time series into a joint predictive distribution over the time steps in one pass using recurrence. For example, processing a sequence of length $10^4$ steps in less than $10^{-2}$ seconds and in $\approx$ 1GB of GPU memory. We demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms other GP-based alternatives and competes with state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting algorithms. }

We obtain a closed-form expression for the isotropic kernel that is approximated, as well as a uniform convergence rate of the uniformly rotated Mondrian kernel to this limit. To this end, we utilize techniques from the theory of stationary random tessellations in stochastic geometry and prove a new result on the geometry of the typical cell of the superposition of uniformly rotated Mondrian tessellations.

In this work, we first observe that these two challenges do not balance out each other. Thus, we propose to apply variational optimization to optimize over the worst-case distribution of the adversary instead of a single worst-case adversary. Moreover, to counteract over-optimism, we train the RL agent to maximize the lower quantile of the cumulative rewards under worst-case adversary distribution. Our novel algorithm demonstrates a significant advancement over existing robust RL methods, corroborating the importance of the identified challenges and the effectiveness of our approach. To alleviate computational overhead associated with the proposed approach, we also propose a simplified version with lower computational burden and only minimal performance degradation.

To address this issue, we leverage the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to handle complex, high-dimensional data while mitigating the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel test procedure, DeepBET. First, a DNN is used on part of the data to estimate the conditional means of $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$. Then, binary expansion testing (BET) are applied to the predicted errors from the remaining data. Additionally, we implement a multiple-split procedure to further enhance the power of the test. DeepBET is computationally efficient and robust to the tuning parameters in DNNs. Interestingly, the DeepBET statistic converges at a root-$n$ rate despite the nonparametric and high-dimensional nature of the confounding effects. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method controls type-I error under various scenarios and enhances both power and interpretability for conditional dependence when present, making it a robust  alternative for testing conditional independence in high-dimensional settings. When applied to dry eye disease data, DeepBET reveals meaningful nonlinear relationships between the epithelial thickness and the tear production in the central region of eyes, given other regions. }

In this paper, we examine the core problem of when all these conditional distributions are consistent with some joint distribution, and whether common models used in practice can learn consistent conditionals. We explore this problem in two settings. First, for the complementary conditioning sets where $S \cup T$ is the complete set of variables, we introduce the concept of path consistency, a necessary condition for a consistent joint. Second, we consider the case where we have access to $p(x_T \mid x_S)$ for all subsets $S$ and $T$. In this case, we propose the concepts of autoregressive and swap consistency, which we show are necessary and sufficient conditions for a consistent joint. For both settings, we analyze when these consistency conditions hold and show that standard discriminative models \emph{may fail to satisfy them}. Finally, we corroborate via experiments that proposed consistency measures can be used as proxies for evaluating the consistency of conditionals $p(x_T \mid x_S)$, and common parameterizations may find it hard to learn true conditionals. }

The effectiveness of the proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application to both simulated and real-world datasets.

    abstract = { This paper introduces and analyzes quantile additive trend filtering, a novel approach to model the conditional quantiles of the response variable given multivariate covariates. Under the assumption that the true model is additive, and that the components are functions whose $r$th order weak derivatives have bounded total variation, our estimator is a constrained version of quantile trend filtering within additive models. The primary theoretical contributions are the error rate of our estimator in both fixed and growing input dimensions. In the fixed dimension case, we show that our estimator attains a rate that mirrors the non-quantile minimax rate for additive trend filtering, featuring the main term $n^{-2r/(2r+1)}$. For growing input dimension ($d$), our rate has an additional polynomial factor $d^{(2r+2)/(2r+1)}$.
    We propose a practical algorithm for implementing quantile additive trend filtering using dimension-wise backfitting.  Experiments in both real data and simulations confirm our theoretical findings. We provide a public implementation of the algorithm at \url{https://github.com/zzh237/QATF.} }

A traditional method for evaluating dataset quality involves training an AI model on the dataset and testing it on a separate test set. However, this approach requires significant computational time. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method for quantifying dataset quality. Specifically, our method measures how well the dataset covers the input probability distribution, ensuring that a high-quality dataset minimizes out-of-distribution inputs.
    We present a GPU-accelerated algorithm for approximately implementing the proposed method. We highlight three applications of our approach. First, it can evaluate the impact of data management practices, such as data cleaning and core set selection. We experimentally demonstrate that the quality assessment provided by our method strongly correlates with the traditional approach, achieving an $R^2 \geq 0.985$ in most cases while being 60-1200 times faster. Second, it can monitor the quality of continuously growing datasets with computation time proportional to the added data size. Finally, our method can estimate the performance of traditional methods for large datasets. }

Motivated by this, to realize the robust invariant learning over temporal graphs, we want to investigate what components in temporal graphs are most invariant and representative with respect to labels. With the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, we propose an error-bounded Invariant Link Selector that can distinguish invariant components and variant components during the training process to make the deep learning model generalizable for different testing scenarios. Besides deriving a series of rigorous generalizable optimization functions, we also equip the training with task-specific loss functions, e.g., temporal link prediction, to make pre-trained models solve real-world application tasks like citation recommendation and merchandise recommendation, as demonstrated in our experiments with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

The inherent non-convexity of the lower-level RL problem is, however, to be an impediment to developing bilevel optimization methods. By employing the fixed point equation associated with the regularized RL, we characterize the hyper-gradient via fully first-order information, thus circumventing the assumption of lower-level convexity. This, remarkably, distinguishes our development of hyper-gradient from the general AID-based bilevel frameworks since we take advantage of the specific structure of RL problems. Moreover, we design both model-based and model-free bilevel reinforcement learning algorithms, facilitated by access to the fully first-order hyper-gradient. Both algorithms enjoy the convergence rate $\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{-1}\right)$. To extend the applicability, a stochastic version of the model-free algorithm is proposed, along with results on its convergence rate and sampling complexity. In addition, numerical experiments demonstrate that the hyper-gradient indeed serves as an integration of exploitation and exploration. }

    abstract = { In learning with invariances (or symmetries), canonicalization is a widely used technique that projects data onto a smaller subset of the input space to reduce associated redundancies. The transformed dataset is then processed through a function from a designated function class to obtain the final invariant representation.
    Although canonicalization is often simple and flexible, both theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the projection map can be discontinuous and unstable, which poses challenges for machine learning applications. However, the overall end-to-end representation can still remain continuous.
    Focusing on the importance of end-to-end regularity rather than the projection mapping itself, this paper explores the continuity and regularity of canonicalized models from a theoretical perspective. In a broad setting of input spaces and group actions, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the continuity or regularity of canonicalized models of any order, thereby characterizing the minimal conditions required for stability.
    To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive investigation into the end-to-end regularity of canonicalized models, offering critical insights into their design and application, as well as guidance for enhancing stability in practical settings. }

    In contrast to conventional wisdom which assumes that high dimensional probabilistic functions will lead to exponential evaluation time, we show that estimand evaluation can be done efficiently, potentially in time linear in the data size, depending on the estimand's hypergraph.
    
    In particular, we show that both the $\it{treewidth}$ and $\it{hypertree width}$ of the estimand's structure bound the evaluation complexity, analogous to their role in bounding the complexity of inference in probabilistic graphical models. In settings with high dimensional functions, the hypertree width often provides a more effective bound, since the empirical distributions are sparse. }

One promising approach is to construct conditional Brenier maps, where the components of the map pushforward a reference distribution to conditionals of the target. While many estimators exist, few, if any, come with statistical or algorithmic guarantees. To this end, we propose a non-parametric estimator for conditional Brenier maps based on the computational scalability of \emph{entropic} optimal transport. Our estimator leverages a result of Carlier et al., (2010), which shows that optimal transport maps under a rescaled quadratic cost asymptotically converge to conditional Brenier maps; our estimator is precisely the entropic analogues of these converging maps. We provide heuristic justifications for how to choose the scaling parameter in the cost as a function of the number of samples by fully characterizing the Gaussian setting. We conclude by comparing the performance of the estimator to other machine learning and non-parametric approaches on benchmark datasets and Bayesian inference problems. }

We tackle this problem by studying measures of invariance that can capture even negligible underlying patterns. Our first contribution is to show that, while detecting subtle asymmetries is computationally intractable, a randomized method can be used to robustly estimate closeness measures to invariance within constant factors. This provides a general framework for robust statistical tests of invariance. Despite the extensive and well-established literature, our methodology, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to provide statistical tests for general group invariances with finite-sample guarantees on Type II errors. In addition, we focus on kernel methods and propose deterministic algorithms for robust testing with respect to both finite and infinite groups, accompanied by a rigorous analysis of their convergence rates and sample complexity. Finally, we revisit the general framework in the specific case of kernel methods, showing that recent closeness measures to invariance, defined via group averaging, are provably robust, leading to powerful randomized algorithms. }

However, our observations indicate that \emph{source-like} samples in target data exhibit less deviation in the feature space of the source model when preserving the source domain-relevant statistics.

    solved problems to expedite solving of new SAT problems. However, one specific area that is often studied in the context of CDCL solvers, but largely overlooked in GNN solvers, is the relationship between graph theoretic measure of structure in SAT problems and the generalisation ability of GNN solvers. To bridge the gap between structural graph properties (e.g., modularity, self-similarity) and the generalisability (or lack thereof) of GNN based SAT solvers, we present StructureSAT: a curated dataset, along with code to further generate novel examples, containing a diverse set of SAT problems from well known problem domains. Furthermore, we utilise a novel splitting method that focuses on deconstructing the families into more detailed hierarchies based on their structural properties. With the new dataset, we aim to help explain problematic generalisation in existing GNN SAT solvers by exploiting knowledge of structural graph properties. We conclude with multiple future directions that can help researchers in GNN based SAT solving develop more effective and generalisable SAT solvers. }

Classifiers under the conformal prediction framework predict a set of plausible labels instead of one single label for each data instance, affording a more cautious and safer decision. We consider a generalization of the covariate shift with posterior drift setting for transfer learning.

We prove that the prior predictive distributions are calibrated in the sense that they are equal to the unconditional density function defined by the diffeomorphism.  Contrary to Bayesian Gaussian MDNs, which exhibit tied functional and distributional complexity, we show that our construction allows to decouple them.

However, standard GP models are limited to continuous variables due to the difficulties in establishing correlation structures for categorical variables. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \textbf{WE}ighted Euclidean distance matrices \textbf{G}aussian \textbf{P}rocess (WEGP). WEGP constructs the kernel function for each categorical input by estimating the Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) among all categorical choices of this input. The EDM is represented as a linear combination of several predefined base EDMs, each scaled by a positive weight. The weights, along with other kernel hyperparameters, are inferred using a fully Bayesian framework. We analyze the predictive performance of WEGP theoretically. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy of our GP model, and by WEGP, into Bayesian Optimization (BO), we achieve superior performance on both synthetic and real-world optimization problems.

We introduce two new objectives for future clinical trials that integrate regulatory constraints and treatment policy value for both the entire population and under-served populations, thus answering some of the questions above in advance. Designed to meet these objectives, we formulate Randomize First Augment Next (RFAN), a new framework for designing Phase III clinical trials. Our framework consists of a standard randomized component followed by an adaptive one, jointly meant to efficiently and safely acquire and assign patients into treatment arms during the trial. Then, we propose strategies for implementing RFAN based on causal, deep Bayesian active learning. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of our framework using synthetic and real-world semi-synthetic datasets. }

Existing techniques are costly, scaling polynomially in computation and memory with the vector size. We introduce LITE, the first approach for estimating Gaussian PoM with \emph{almost-linear time and memory} complexity. LITE achieves SOTA accuracy on a number of tasks, while being in practice several orders of magnitude faster than the baselines.

When $n$ is the number of nodes in the input graph, we show that the expected $\ell_2$ error of our algorithm is $O(n^{k - 1})$. Additionally, we prove that there exists a class of input graphs and graphlets of size $k$ for which any non-interactive counting algorithm incurs an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1})$, demonstrating the optimality of our result.

In this work, we systematically investigate this across a number of datasets, neural network architectures, and BNN approximation methods and surprisingly find that when the ensembles grow large enough, DEs consistently outperform DE-BNNs on in-distribution data. To shine light on this observation, we conduct several sensitivity and ablation studies. Moreover, we show that even though DE-BNNs outperform DEs on out-of-distribution metrics, this comes at the cost of decreased in-distribution performance. As a final contribution, we open-source the large pool of trained models to facilitate further research on this topic. }

Uncertainty quantification is particularly important in personalized federated learning (PFL), as participating clients typically have small local datasets, making it difficult to unambiguously determine optimal model parameters. Bayesian PFL (BPFL) methods can potentially enhance calibration, but they often come with considerable computational and memory requirements due to the need to track the variances of all the individual model parameters. Furthermore, different clients may exhibit heterogeneous uncertainty levels owing to varying local dataset sizes and distributions. To address these challenges, we propose LR-BPFL, a novel BPFL method that learns a global deterministic model along with personalized low-rank Bayesian corrections. To tailor the local model to each client's inherent uncertainty level, LR-BPFL incorporates an adaptive rank selection mechanism. We evaluate LR-BPFL across a variety of datasets, demonstrating its advantages in terms of calibration, accuracy, as well as computational and memory requirements.

While teleportation intuitively speeds-up GD via bigger steps, current work lacks convergence theory for convex functions, guarantees for solving the teleportation operator, and even clear empirical evidence showing this acceleration. We resolve these open questions. For convex functions satisfying Hessian stability, we prove that GD with teleportation obtains a combined sub-linear/linear convergence rate which is strictly faster than GD when the optimality gap is small. This is in sharp contrast to the standard (strongly) convex setting, where teleportation neither improves nor worsens convergence. To evaluate teleportation in practice, we develop a projected-gradient method requiring only Hessian-vector products. We use this to show that gradient methods with access to a teleportation oracle out-perform their standard versions on a variety of problems. We also find that GD with teleportation is faster than truncated Newton methods, particularly for non-convex optimization. }

We formulate an optimization sub-problem that minimizes catastrophic forgetting, translating CFL into an iterative algorithm with adaptive learning rates that ensure seamless learning across tasks.

In the present work, we propose a practical and effective implementation of the second approach, which bypasses explicit density ratio estimation and is suitable for continuous and high-dimensional treatments.

While the need for datasets with realistic noise distribution has partially been addressed by web-scraped benchmarks such as WebVision and Clothing1M, those benchmarks are restricted to the computer vision domain. With the growing importance of Transformer-based models, it is crucial to establish text classification benchmarks for learning with noisy labels. 
    
    In this paper, we present AlleNoise, a new curated text classification dataset with real-world instance-dependent label noise, containing over 500,000 examples across approximately 5600 classes, complemented with a meaningful, hierarchical taxonomy of categories. The noise distribution comes from actual users of a major e-commerce marketplace, so it realistically reflects the semantics of human mistakes. In addition to the noisy labels, we provide human-verified clean labels, which help to get a deeper insight into the noise distribution, unlike web-scraped datasets typically used in the field. We demonstrate that a representative selection of established methods for learning with noisy labels is inadequate to handle such real-world noise. In addition, we show evidence that these algorithms do not alleviate excessive memorization. As such, with AlleNoise, we set a high bar for the development of label noise methods that can handle real-world label noise in text classification tasks.

We introduce a novel framework to track the evolution of the feature manifold during training, revealing how the hierarchy of class relations emerges and refines across the network layers. Our analysis demonstrates that the learned representations closely align with the semantic structure of the dataset, providing a quantitative description of the clustering process. Notably, we show that in the hypernym label space, certain properties of neuronal collapse appear earlier than in the hyponym label space, helping to bridge the gap between the initial and terminal phases of learning. We believe our findings offer new insights into the mechanisms driving hierarchical learning in deep networks, paving the way for future advancements in understanding deep learning dynamics. }

    We address multi-objective model parameter optimization via a surrogate single objective penalty loss with time-varying multipliers, equivalent to online scheduling of loss landscape. 
    The multi-objective descent goal is dispatched hierarchically into a series of constraint optimization sub-problems with shrinking bounds according to Pareto dominance. The bound serves as setpoint for the low-level multiplier controller to schedule loss landscapes via output feedback of each loss term. Our method forms closed loop of model parameter dynamic, circumvents excessive memory requirements and extra computational burden of existing multi-objective deep learning methods, and is robust against controller hyperparameter variation, demonstrated on domain generalization tasks. }

    stationary and non-stationary processes and exploit the potential rapid decay of correlations between temporally separated variables to improve estimation. We demonstrate the utility of these bounds by applying them to covariance operator estimation in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning in dynamical systems, achieving novel risk bounds.  Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts. }

    abstract = { Training generative models to sample from unnormalized density functions is an important and challenging task in machine learning. 
    Traditional training methods often rely on the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence due to its tractability. However, the mode-seeking behavior of reverse KL hinders effective approximation of multi-modal target distributions. To address this, we propose to minimize the reverse KL along diffusion trajectories of both model and target densities. We refer to this objective as the reverse diffusive KL divergence, which allows the model to capture multiple modes. Leveraging this objective, we train neural samplers that can efficiently generate samples from the target distribution in one step. We demonstrate that our method enhances sampling performance across various Boltzmann distributions, including both synthetic multi-modal densities and n-body particle systems. }

    abstract = { Optimizing expensive, non-convex, black-box Lipschitz continuous functions presents significant challenges, particularly when the Lipschitz constant of the underlying function is unknown. Such problems often demand numerous function evaluations to approximate the global optimum, which can be prohibitive in terms of time, energy, or resources. In this work, we introduce Every Call is Precious (ECP), a novel global optimization algorithm that minimizes unpromising evaluations by strategically focusing on potentially optimal regions. Unlike previous approaches, ECP eliminates the need to estimate the Lipschitz constant, thereby avoiding additional function evaluations. ECP guarantees no-regret performance for infinite evaluation budgets and achieves minimax-optimal regret bounds within finite budgets. Extensive ablation studies validate the algorithm's robustness, while empirical evaluations show that ECP outperforms 10 benchmark algorithms---including Lipschitz, Bayesian, bandits, and evolutionary methods---across 30 multi-dimensional non-convex synthetic and real-world optimization problems, which positions ECP as a competitive approach for global optimization. }

    abstract = { Microcanonical gradient descent is a sampling procedure for energy-based models allowing for efficient sampling of distributions in high dimension. It works by transporting samples from a high-entropy distribution, such as Gaussian white noise, to a low-energy region using gradient descent. We put this model in the framework of normalizing flows, showing how it can often overfit by losing an unnecessary amount of entropy in the descent. As a remedy, we propose a mean-field microcanonical gradient descent that samples several weakly coupled data points simultaneously, allowing for better control of the entropy loss while paying little in terms of likelihood fit. We study these models in the context of stationary time series and 2D textures. }

Recent work proposes sharing information across similar actions to mitigate this problem. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator that shares information across similar contexts using clustering. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed estimator, characterizing its bias and variance under different conditions. We also compare the performance of the proposed estimator and existing approaches in various synthetic problems, as well as a real-world recommendation dataset. Our experimental results confirm that clustering contexts improves estimation accuracy, especially in deficient information settings. }

    abstract = { In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications. }

    abstract = { Understanding how neural networks transform input data across layers is fundamental to unraveling their learning and generalization capabilities. Although prior work has used insights from kernel methods to study neural networks, a global analysis of how the similarity between hidden representations evolves across layers remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for the evolution of the kernel sequence, which measures the similarity between the hidden representation for two different inputs. Operating under the mean-field regime, we show that the kernel sequence evolves deterministically via a kernel map, which only depends on the activation function. By expanding activation using Hermite polynomials and using their algebraic properties, we derive an explicit form for kernel map and fully characterize its fixed points. Our analysis reveals that for nonlinear activations, the kernel sequence converges globally to a unique fixed point, which can correspond to orthogonal or similar representations depending on the activation and network architecture. We further extend our results to networks with residual connections and normalization layers, demonstrating similar convergence behaviors. This work provides new insights into the implicit biases of deep neural networks and how architectural choices influence the evolution of representations across layers. }

    abstract = { Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable natural language capabilities. However, when deploying them in real-world settings, it is important to align LLMs to generate texts according to acceptable human standards. Methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have enabled significant progress in refining LLMs using human preference data. However, the privacy concerns inherent in utilizing such preference data have yet to be adequately studied. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of LLMs aligned using two widely used methods - DPO and PPO - to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our study has two main contributions: first, we theoretically motivate that DPO models are more vulnerable to MIA compared to PPO models; second, we introduce a novel reference-based attack framework specifically for analyzing preference data called PREMIA (Preference data MIA). Using PREMIA and existing baselines we empirically show that DPO models have a relatively heightened vulnerability towards MIA. }

This is done by replacing the independence assumption with a weaker assumption about the interaction between the axes; there are several choices for which assumption to use.  In single-cell RNA sequencing data, genes may interact differently depending on whether they are expressed in the same cell, or in different cells.  Unfortunately, current methods are not able to make this distinction.  In this paper, we address this problem by introducing the strong product model for Gaussian graphical modelling. }
