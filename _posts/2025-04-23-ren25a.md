title: Scalable spectral representations for multiagent reinforcement learning in
  network MDPs

openreview: iUYgEe5gmO
abstract: Network Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which are the de-facto model for
  multi-agent control, pose a significant challenge to efficient learning caused by
  the exponential growth of the global state-action space with the number of agents.
  In this work, utilizing the exponential decay property of network dynamics, we first
  derive scalable spectral local representations for multiagent reinforcement learning
  in network MDPs, which induces a network linear subspace for the local $Q$-function
  of each agent. Building on these local spectral representations, we design a scalable
  algorithmic framework for multiagent reinforcement learning in continuous state-action
  network MDPs, and provide end-to-end guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm.
  Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of our scalable representation-based
  approach on two benchmark problems, and demonstrate the advantages of our approach
  over generic function approximation approaches to representing the local $Q$-functions.
