abstract: " Deterministic mathematical models, such as those specified via differential
  equations, are a powerful tool to communicate scientific insight.      However,
  such models are necessarily simplified descriptions of the real world.  Generalised
  Bayesian methodologies have been proposed for inference with misspecified models,
  but these are typically associated with vanishing parameter uncertainty as more
  data are observed.  In the context of a misspecified deterministic mathematical
  model, this has the undesirable consequence that posterior predictions become deterministic
  and certain, while being incorrect.  Taking this observation as a starting point,
  we propose \\emph{Prediction-Centric Uncertainty Quantification}, where a mixture
  distribution based on the deterministic model confers improved uncertainty quantification
  in the predictive context.  Computation of the mixing distribution is cast as a
  (regularised) gradient flow of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), enabling consistent
  numerical approximations to be obtained.  Results are reported on both a toy model
  from population ecology and a real model of protein signalling in cell biology. "
