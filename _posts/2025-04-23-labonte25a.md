abstract: " Modern machine learning methods have recently demonstrated remarkable
  capability to generalize under task shift, where latent knowledge is transferred
  to a different, often more difficult, task under a similar data distribution. We
  investigate this phenomenon in an overparameterized linear regression setting where
  the task shifts from classification during training to regression during evaluation.
  In the zero-shot case, wherein no regression data is available, we prove that task
  shift is impossible in both sparse signal and random signal models for any Gaussian
  covariate distribution. In the few-shot case, wherein limited regression data is
  available, we propose a simple postprocessing algorithm which asymptotically recovers
  the ground-truth predictor. Our analysis leverages a fine-grained characterization
  of individual parameters arising from minimum-norm interpolation which may be of
  independent interest. Our results show that while minimum-norm interpolators for
  classification cannot transfer to regression a priori, they experience surprisingly
  structured attenuation which enables successful task shift with limited additional
  data. "
