abstract: " Symbolic regression (SR) is a machine learning approach aimed at discovering
  mathematical closed-form expressions that best fit a given dataset. Traditional
  complexity measures in SR, such as the number of terms or expression tree depth,
  often fail to capture the difficulty of specific analytical tasks a user might need
  to perform. In this paper, we introduce a new complexity measure designed to quantify
  the difficulty of conducting single-feature global perturbation analysis (SGPA)â€”a
  type of analysis commonly applied in fields like physics and risk scoring to understand
  the global impact of perturbing individual input features. We present a unified
  mathematical framework that formalizes and generalizes these established practices,
  providing a precise method to assess how challenging it is to apply SGPA to different
  closed-form equations. This approach enables the definition of novel complexity
  metrics and constraints directly tied to this practical analytical task. Additionally,
  we establish a reconstruction theorem, offering potential insights for developing
  future optimization techniques in SR. "
