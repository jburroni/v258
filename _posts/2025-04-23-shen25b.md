abstract: " Practitioners often aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using
  sample snapshots at multiple time points. E.g. given single-cell sequencing data,
  scientists would like to learn how gene expression changes over a cell’s life cycle.
  But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we can access data for any particular
  cell only at a single time point, but we have data across many cells. The deep learning
  community has recently explored using Schr{ö}dinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions
  in similar settings. However, existing methods either (1) interpolate between just
  two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic (often set to Brownian
  motion within SB). But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to
  capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify
  a model class for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters
  within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories
  from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification
  only of a class of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. We demonstrate the
  advantages of our method on simulated and real data. "
