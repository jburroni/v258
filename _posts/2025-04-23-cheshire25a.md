title: Active Bipartite Ranking with Smooth Posterior Distributions

abstract: In this article, bipartite ranking, a statistical learning problem involved
  in many applications and widely studied in the passive context, is approached in
  a much more general active setting than the discrete one previously considered in
  the literature. While the latter assumes that the conditional distribution is piece
  wise constant, the framework we develop permits in contrast to deal with continuous
  conditional distributions, provided that they fulfill a H{ö}lder smoothness constraint.
  We first show that a naive approach based on discretisation at a uniform level,
  fixed a priori and consisting in applying next the active strategy designed for
  the discrete setting generally fails. Instead, we propose a novel algorithm, referred
  to as smooth-rank and designed for the continuous setting, which aims to minimise
  the distance between the ROC curve of the estimated ranking rule and the optimal
  one w.r.t. the $\sup$ norm. We show that, for a fixed confidence level $\epsilon>0$
  and probability $\delta\in (0,1)$, smooth-rank is PAC$(\epsilon,\delta)$. In addition,
  we provide a problem dependent upper bound on the expected sampling time of smooth-rank
  and establish a problem dependent lower bound on the expected sampling time of any
  PAC$(\epsilon,\delta)$ algorithm. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, numerical
  results are presented, providing solid empirical evidence of the performance of
  the algorithm proposed, which compares favorably with alternative approaches.
