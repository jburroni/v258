abstract: " Modelling causal effects from observational data for deciding policy actions
  can benefit from being interpretable and transparent; both due to the high stakes
  involved and the inherent lack of ground truth labels to evaluate the accuracy of
  such models. To date, attempts at transparent causal effect estimation consist of
  applying post hoc explanation methods to black-box models, which are not interpretable.
  Here, we present BICauseTree: an interpretable balancing method that identifies
  clusters where natural experiments occur locally. Our approach builds on decision
  trees with a customized objective function to improve balancing and reduce treatment
  allocation bias. Consequently, it can additionally detect subgroups presenting positivity
  violations, exclude them, and provide a covariate-based definition of the target
  population we can infer from and generalize to. We evaluate the methodâ€™s performance
  using synthetic and realistic datasets, explore its bias-interpretability tradeoff,
  and show that it is comparable with existing approaches. "
