abstract: " Score distillation has emerged as one of the most prevalent approaches
  for text-to-3D asset synthesis. Essentially, score distillation updates 3D parameters
  by lifting and back-propagating scores averaged over different views. In this paper,
  we reveal that the gradient estimation in score distillation is inherent to high
  variance. Through the lens of variance reduction, the effectiveness of SDS and VSD
  can be interpreted as applications of various control variates to the Monte Carlo
  estimator of the distilled score. Motivated by this rethinking and based on Steinâ€™s
  identity, we propose a more general solution to reduce variance for score distillation,
  termed \\emph{Stein Score Distillation (SSD)}. SSD incorporates control variates
  constructed by Stein identity, allowing for arbitrary baseline functions. This enables
  us to include flexible guidance priors and network architectures to explicitly optimize
  for variance reduction. In our experiments, the overall pipeline, dubbed \\emph{SteinDreamer},
  is implemented by instantiating the control variate with a monocular depth estimator.
  The results show that SSD can effectively reduce the distillation variance and consistently
  improve visual quality for both object- and scene-level generation. "
