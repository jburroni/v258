abstract: Evaluating dataset quality is an essential task, as the performance of artificial
  intelligence (AI) systems heavily depends on it. A traditional method for evaluating
  dataset quality involves training an AI model on the dataset and testing it on a
  separate test set. However, this approach requires significant computational time.
  In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method for quantifying dataset
  quality. Specifically, our method measures how well the dataset covers the input
  probability distribution, ensuring that a high-quality dataset minimizes out-of-distribution
  inputs. We present a GPU-accelerated algorithm for approximately implementing the
  proposed method. We highlight three applications of our approach. First, it can
  evaluate the impact of data management practices, such as data cleaning and core
  set selection. We experimentally demonstrate that the quality assessment provided
  by our method strongly correlates with the traditional approach, achieving an $R^2
  \geq 0.985$ in most cases while being 60-1200 times faster. Second, it can monitor
  the quality of continuously growing datasets with computation time proportional
  to the added data size. Finally, our method can estimate the performance of traditional
  methods for large datasets.
