title: " Heterogeneous Graph Structure Learning through the Lens of Data-generating
  Processes "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=JHK0QBKdYY "
abstract: " Inferring the graph structure from observed data is a key task in graph
  machine learning to capture the intrinsic relationship between data entities. While
  significant advancements have been made in learning the structure of homogeneous
  graphs, many real-world graphs exhibit heterogeneous patterns where nodes and edges
  have multiple types. This paper fills this gap by introducing the first approach
  for heterogeneous graph structure learning (HGSL). To this end, we first propose
  a novel statistical model for the data-generating process (DGP) of heterogeneous
  graph data, namely hidden Markov networks for heterogeneous graphs (H2MN). Then
  we formalize HGSL as a maximum a-posterior estimation problem parameterized by such
  DGP and derive an alternating optimization method to obtain a solution together
  with a theoretical justification of the optimization conditions. Finally, we conduct
  extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that
  our proposed method excels in learning structure on heterogeneous graphs in terms
  of edge type identification and edge weight recovery. "
