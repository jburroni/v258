title: " Composition and Control with Distilled Energy Diffusion Models and Sequential
  Monte Carlo "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=6GyX0YRw8P "
abstract: " Diffusion models may be formulated as a time-indexed sequence of energy-based
  models, where the score corresponds to the negative gradient of an energy function.
  As opposed to learning the score directly, an energy parameterization is attractive
  as the energy itself can be used to control generation via Monte Carlo samplers.
  Architectural constraints and training instability in energy parameterized models
  have so far yielded inferior performance compared to directly approximating the
  score or denoiser. We address these deficiencies by introducing a novel training
  regime for the energy function through distillation of pre-trained diffusion models,
  resembling a Helmholtz decomposition of the score vector field. We further showcase
  the synergies between energy and score by casting the diffusion sampling procedure
  as a Feynman Kac Model where sampling is controlled using potentials from the learnt
  energy functions.  The Feynman Kac model formalism enables composition and low temperature
  sampling through sequential Monte Carlo. "
