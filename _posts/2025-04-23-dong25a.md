abstract: 'Many applications require minimizing a family of optimization problems
  indexed by some hyperparameter $\lambda \in \Lambda$ to obtain an entire solution
  path. Traditional approaches proceed by discretizing $\Lambda$ and solving a series
  of optimization problems. We propose an alternative approach that parameterizes
  the solution path with a set of basis functions and solves a \emph{single} stochastic
  optimization problem to learn the entire solution path.  Our method offers substantial
  complexity improvements over discretization. When using constant-step size SGD,
  the uniform error of our learned solution path relative to the true path exhibits
  linear convergence to a constant related to the expressiveness of the basis. When
  the true solution path lies in the span of the basis, this constant is zero. We
  also prove stronger results for special cases common in machine learning: When $\lambda
  \in [-1, 1]$ and the solution path is $\nu$-times differentiable, constant step-size
  SGD learns a path with $\epsilon$ uniform error after at most $O(\epsilon^{\frac{1}{1-\nu}}
  \log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, and when the solution path is analytic, it only requires
  $O\left(\log^2(1/\epsilon)\log\log(1/\epsilon)\right)$.  By comparison, the best-known
  discretization schemes in these settings require at least $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ discretization
  points (and even more gradient calls). Finally, we propose an adaptive variant of
  our method that sequentially adds basis functions and demonstrate strong numerical
  performance through experiments.'
