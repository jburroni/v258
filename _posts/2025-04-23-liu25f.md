title: Information-Theoretic Measures on Lattices for Higher-Order Interactions
openreview: PfJvU4bAQX
abstract: Traditional measures based solely on pairwise associations often fail to
  capture the complex statistical structure of multivariate data. Existing approaches
  for identifying information shared among $d>3$ variables are frequently computationally
  intractable, asymmetric with respect to a target variable, or unable to account
  for all the ways in which the joint probability distribution can be factorised.
  Here we present a systematic framework based on lattice theory to derive higher-order
  information-theoretic measures for multivariate data. Our construction uses lattice
  and operator function pairs, whereby an operator function is applied over a lattice
  that represents the algebraic relationships among variables. We show that many commonly
  used measures can be derived within this framework, yet they fail to capture all
  interactions for $d>3$, either because they are defined on restricted sublattices,
  or because the use of the KL divergence as an operator function, a typical choice,
  leads to undesired disregard of groups of interactions. To fully characterise all
  interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg Information, which
  is defined over the full partition lattice and uses generalised divergences (beyond
  KL) as operator functions. We validate the Streitberg Information on synthetic data,
  and illustrate its application in detecting complex interactions among stocks, decoding
  neural signals, and performing feature selection in machine learning.
