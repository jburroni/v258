title: Truncated Inverse-Lévy Measure Representation of the Beta Process
software: https://github.com/DrJunyiZhang/TILe-Rep-Beta
openreview: 44w2O8tJ9v
abstract: The beta process is a widely used nonparametric prior in Bayesian machine
  learning. While various inference schemes have been developed for the beta process
  and related models, the current state-of-the-art method relies heavily on the stick-breaking
  representation with decreasing atom weights, which is available only for a special
  hyperparameter. In this paper, we introduce the truncated inverse-L{é}vy measure
  representation (TILe-Rep) that extends the decreasing atom weights representation
  of the beta process to general hyperparameters. The TILe-Rep fills the gap between
  the two stick-breaking representations in Teh et al. (2007) and Paisley et al. (2010).
  Moreover, it has a lower truncation error compared to other sequential representations
  of the beta process and potentially leads to the posterior consistency property
  of the Bayesian factor models. We demonstrate the usage of the TILe-Rep in the celebrated
  beta process factor analysis model and beta process sparse factor model.
