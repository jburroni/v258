title: 'Contractivity and linear convergence  in bilinear saddle-point problems: An
  operator-theoretic approach'
openreview: YIlZdkeb05
abstract: We study the convex-concave bilinear saddle-point problem $\min_x \max_y
  f(x) + y^\top Ax - g(y)$, where both, only one, or none of the functions $f$ and
  $g$ are strongly convex, and suitable rank conditions on the matrix $A$ hold. The
  solution of this problem is at the core of many machine learning tasks. By employing
  tools from monotone operator theory, we systematically prove the contractivity (in
  turn, the linear convergence) of several first-order primal-dual algorithms, including
  the Chambolleâ€“Pock method. Our approach results in concise  proofs, and it yields
  new convergence guarantees and tighter bounds compared to known results.
