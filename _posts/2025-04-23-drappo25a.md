openreview: GP8nMmE8jo
abstract: We study goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), where
  a high-level agent instructs sub-goals to a low-level agent. Under the assumption
  of a sparse reward function and known hierarchical decomposition, we propose a new
  algorithm to learn optimal hierarchical policies. Our algorithm takes a low-level
  policy as input and is flexible enough to work with a wide range of low-level policies.
  We show that when the algorithm that computes the low-level policy is optimistic
  and provably efficient, our HRL algorithm enjoys a regret bound which represents
  a significant improvement compared to previous results for HRL. Importantly, our
  regret upper bound highlights key characteristics of the hierarchical decomposition
  that guarantee that our hierarchical algorithm is more efficient than the best monolithic
  approach. We support our theoretical findings with experiments that underscore that
  our method consistently outperforms algorithms that ignore the hierarchical structure.
