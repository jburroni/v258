abstract: " Gaussian processes have been used to model the vector field of continuous
  dynamical systems, which are characterized by a probabilistic ordinary differential
  equation (GP-ODE). Bayesian inference for these models has been extensively studied
  and applied in tasks such as time series prediction. However, the use of standard
  GPs with basic kernels like squared exponential  kernels has been common in GP-ODE
  research, limiting the modelâ€™s ability to represent complex scenarios. To address
  this limitation, we introduce normalizing flows to reparameterize the ODE vector
  field, resulting in a data-driven prior distribution, thereby increasing flexibility
  and expressive power. We develop a variational inference algorithm that utilizes
  analytically tractable probability density functions of normalizing flows. Additionally,
  we also apply normalizing flows to the posterior inference of GP-ODEs to resolve
  the issue of strong mean-field assumptions. By applying normalizing flows in these
  ways, our model improves accuracy and uncertainty estimates for Bayesian GP-ODEs.
  We validate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated dynamical systems and
  real-world human motion data, including time series prediction and missing data
  recovery tasks. "
