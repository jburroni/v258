abstract: " Covariance matrix estimation is a fundamental problem in multivariate
  data analysis, which becomes particularly challenging in high-dimensional settings
  due to the curse of dimensionality. To enhance estimation accuracy, structural regularization
  is often imposed on the precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) for covariance
  selection. In this paper, we study covariance selection in a distributed setting,
  where data is spread across a network of agents. We formulate the problem as a Gaussian
  maximum likelihood estimation problem with structural penalties and propose a novel
  algorithmic framework called NetGGM. Unlike existing methods that rely on a central
  coordinator, NetGGM operates in a fully decentralized manner with low computational
  complexity. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that NetGGM converges linearly
  to the global optimum while ensuring consensus among agents. Numerical experiments
  validate its convergence properties and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods in precision matrix estimation. "
