abstract: " This paper explores locally differentially private distributed algorithms
  that solve non-convex empirical risk minimization problems.  Traditional approaches
  often assume uniformly bounded stochastic gradients, which may not hold in practice.
  \ To address this issue, we propose differentially \\textbf{Pri}vate \\textbf{S}tochastic
  recursive \\textbf{M}omentum with gr\\textbf{A}dient clipping (PriSMA) that judiciously
  integrates clipping and momentum to enhance utility while guaranteeing privacy.
  Without assuming uniformly bounded stochastic gradients, given privacy requirement
  $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$, PriSMA achieves a learning error of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\big((\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\sqrt{M}N\\epsilon})^\\frac{2}{5}\\big)$,
  where $M$ is the number of clients, $N$ is the number of data samples on each client
  and $d$ is the model dimension. This learning error bound is better than the state-of-the-art
  $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\big((\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{{\\sqrt{M}N\\epsilon}})^\\frac{1}{3}\\big)$
  in terms of the dependence on $M$ and $N$. "
