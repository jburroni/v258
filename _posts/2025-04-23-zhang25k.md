title: Quantile Additive Trend Filtering
software: https://github.com/zzh237/QATF
openreview: fVVoSOUQ8U
abstract: This paper introduces and analyzes quantile additive trend filtering, a
  novel approach to model the conditional quantiles of the response variable given
  multivariate covariates. Under the assumption that the true model is additive, and
  that the components are functions whose $r$th order weak derivatives have bounded
  total variation, our estimator is a constrained version of quantile trend filtering
  within additive models. The primary theoretical contributions are the error rate
  of our estimator in both fixed and growing input dimensions. In the fixed dimension
  case, we show that our estimator attains a rate that mirrors the non-quantile minimax
  rate for additive trend filtering, featuring the main term $n^{-2r/(2r+1)}$. For
  growing input dimension ($d$), our rate has an additional polynomial factor $d^{(2r+2)/(2r+1)}$.
  We propose a practical algorithm for implementing quantile additive trend filtering
  using dimension-wise backfitting.  Experiments in both real data and simulations
  confirm our theoretical findings. We provide a public implementation of the algorithm
