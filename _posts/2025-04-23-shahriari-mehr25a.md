title: 'Asynchronous Decentralized Optimization with Constraints: Achievable Speeds
  of Convergence for Directed Graphs'
openreview: fm4PSeWaaQ
abstract: We propose a novel decentralized convex optimization algorithm called ASY-DAGP,
  where each agent has its own distinct objective function and constraint set. Agents
  compute at different speeds, and their communication is delayed and directed. Employing
  local buffers, ASY-DAGP enhances asynchronous communication and is robust to challenging
  scenarios such as message failure. We validate these features by numerical experiments.
  By analyzing ASY-DAGP, we provide the first sublinear convergence rate for the above
  setup under mild assumptions. This rate depends on a novel characterization of delay
  profiles, which we term the delay factor. We calculate the delay factor for the
  well-known bounded delay profiles, providing new insights for these scenarios. Our
  analysis is conducted by introducing a novel approach tied to the celebrated PEP
  framework. Our approach does not require the design of Lyapunov functions and instead
  provides a novel insight into the optimization algorithms as linear systems.
