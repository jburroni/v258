title: 'ROTI-GCV: Generalized Cross-Validation for right-ROTationally Invariant Data'

abstract: Two key tasks in high-dimensional regularized regression are tuning the
  regularization strength for accurate predictions and estimating the out-of-sample
  risk. It is known that the standard approach — $k$-fold cross-validation — is inconsistent
  in modern high-dimensional settings. While leave-one-out and generalized cross-validation
  remain consistent in some high-dimensional cases, they become inconsistent when
  samples are dependent or contain heavy-tailed covariates. As a first step towards
  modeling structured sample dependence and heavy tails, we use right-rotationally
  invariant covariate distributions — a crucial concept from compressed sensing. In
  the proportional asymptotics regime where the number of features and samples grow
  comparably, which is known to better reflect the empirical behavior in moderately
  sized datasets, we introduce a new framework, ROTI-GCV, for reliably performing
  cross-validation under these challenging conditions. Along the way, we propose new
  estimators for the signal-to-noise ratio and noise variance. We conduct experiments
  that demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in a variety of synthetic and semi-synthetic
  settings.
