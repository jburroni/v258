abstract: " Auto Feature Engineering (AFE) plays a crucial role in developing practical
  machine learning pipelines by automating the transformation of raw data into meaningful
  features that enhance model performance. By generating features in a data-driven
  manner, AFE enables the discovery of important features that may not be apparent
  through human experience or intuition. On the other hand, since AFE generates features
  based on data, there is a risk that these features may be overly adapted to the
  data, making it essential to assess their reliability appropriately. Unfortunately,
  because most AFE problems are formulated as combinatorial search problems and solved
  by heuristic algorithms, it has been challenging to theoretically quantify the reliability
  of generated features. To address this issue, we propose a new statistical test
  for generated features by AFE algorithms based on a framework called selective inference.
  As a proof of concept, we consider a simple class of tree search-based heuristic
  AFE algorithms, and consider the problem of testing the generated features when
  they are used in a linear model. The proposed test can quantify the statistical
  significance of the generated features in the form of $p$-values, enabling theoretically
  guaranteed control of the risk of false findings. "
