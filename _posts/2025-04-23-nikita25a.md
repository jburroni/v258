title: Efficient Estimation of a Gaussian Mean  with Local Differential Privacy
openreview: cX6al5QIbN
abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the unknown mean $\theta$
  of a unit variance Gaussian distribution in a locally differentially private (LDP)
  way. In the high-privacy regime ($\epsilon\le 1$), we identify an optimal privacy
  mechanism that minimizes the variance of the estimator asymptotically. Our main
  technical contribution is the maximization of the Fisher-Information of the sanitized
  data with respect to the local privacy mechanism $Q$. We find that the exact solution
  $Q_{\theta,\epsilon}$ of this maximization is the sign mechanism that applies randomized
  response to the sign of $X_i-\theta$, where $X_1,â€¦, X_n$ are the confidential iid
  original samples. However, since this optimal local mechanism depends on the unknown
  mean $\theta$, we employ a two-stage LDP parameter estimation procedure which requires
  splitting agents into two groups. The first $n_1$ observations are used to consistently
  but not necessarily efficiently estimate the parameter $\theta$ by $\tilde{\theta_{n_1}}$.
  Then this estimate is updated by applying the sign mechanism with $\tilde{\theta}_{n_1}$
  instead of $\theta$ to the remaining $n-n_1$ observations, to obtain an LDP and
  efficient estimator of the unknown mean.
