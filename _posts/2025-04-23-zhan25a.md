title: " Analyzing the Role of Permutation Invariance in Linear Mode Connectivity "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=cDYM7MGYFX "
abstract: " It was empirically observed in Enterazi et al. (2021) that when accounting
  for the permutation invariance of neural networks, there is likely no loss barrier
  along the linear interpolation between two SGD solutions â€“ a phenomenon known as
  linear mode connectivity (LMC) modulo permutation. This phenomenon has sparked significant
  attention due to both its theoretical interest and practical relevance in applications
  such as model merging. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of this
  phenomenon for two-layer ReLU networks under a teacher-student setup. We show that
  as the student network width $m$ increases,  the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation
  exhibits a double descent behavior. Particularly, when $m$ is sufficiently large,
  the barrier decreases to zero at a rate $O(m^{-1/2})$. Notably,  this rate does
  not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and demonstrates how substantial permutation
  can reduce the LMC loss barrier. Moreover, we observe a sharp transition in the
  sparsity of GD/SGD solutions when increasing the learning rate and investigate how
  this sparsity preference affects the LMC loss barrier modulo permutation. Experiments
  on both synthetic and MNIST datasets corroborate our theoretical predictions and
  reveal a similar trend for more complex network architectures. "
