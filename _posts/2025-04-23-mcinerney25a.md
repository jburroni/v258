title: Variation Due to Regularization Tractably Recovers Bayesian Deep Learning Uncertainty
software: https://github.com/jamesmcinerney/regvar
openreview: E4IFPgNLby
abstract: Uncertainty quantification in deep learning is crucial for safe and reliable
  decision-making in downstream tasks. Existing methods quantify uncertainty at the
  last layer or other approximations of the network which may miss some sources of
  uncertainty in the model. To address this gap, we propose an uncertainty quantification
  method for large networks based on variation due to regularization. Essentially,
  predictions that are more (less) sensitive to the regularization of network parameters
  are less (more, respectively) certain. This principle can be implemented by deterministically
  tweaking the training loss during the fine-tuning phase and reflects confidence
  in the output as a function of all layers of the network. We show that regularization
  variation (RegVar) provides rigorous uncertainty estimates that, in the infinitesimal
  limit, exactly recover the Laplace approximation in Bayesian deep learning. We demonstrate
  its success in several deep learning architectures, showing it can scale tractably
  with the network size while maintaining or improving uncertainty quantification
  quality. Our experiments across multiple datasets show that RegVar not only identifies
  uncertain predictions effectively but also provides insights into the stability
  of learned representations.
