abstract: " Evaluating machine learning models is crucial not only for determining
  their technical accuracy but also for assessing their potential societal implications.
  While the potential for low-sample-size bias in algorithms is well known, we demonstrate
  the significance of sample-size bias induced by combinatorics in classification
  metrics. This revelation challenges the efficacy of these metrics in assessing bias
  with high resolution, especially when comparing groups of disparate sizes, which
  frequently arise in social applications. We provide analyses of the bias that appears
  in several commonly applied metrics and propose a model-agnostic assessment and
  correction technique. Additionally, we analyze counts of undefined cases in metric
  calculations, which can lead to misleading evaluations if improperly handled. This
  work illuminates the previously unrecognized challenge of combinatorics and probability
  in standard evaluation practices and thereby advances approaches for performing
  fair and trustworthy classification methods. "
