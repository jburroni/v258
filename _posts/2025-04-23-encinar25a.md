title: " Deep Optimal Sensor Placement for Black Box Stochastic Simulations "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=446GZolzar "
abstract: " Selecting cost-effective optimal sensor configurations for subsequent
  inference of parameters in black-box stochastic systems faces significant computational
  barriers. We propose a novel and robust approach,  modelling the joint distribution
  over input parameters and solution with a joint energy-based model, trained on simulation
  data. Unlike existing simulation-based inference approaches, which must be tied
  to a specific set of point evaluations, we learn a functional representation of
  parameters and solution. This is used as a resolution-independent plug-and-play
  surrogate for the joint distribution, which can be conditioned over any set of points,
  permitting an efficient approach to sensor placement. We demonstrate the validity
  of our framework on a variety of stochastic problems, showing that our method provides
  highly informative sensor locations at a lower computational cost compared to conventional
  approaches. "
