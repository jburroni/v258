title: 'M$^2$AD: Multi-Sensor Multi-System Anomaly Detection through Global Scoring
  and Calibrated Thresholding'

abstract: With the widespread availability of sensor data across industrial and operational
  systems, we frequently encounter heterogeneous time series from multiple systems.
  Anomaly detection is crucial for such systems to facilitate predictive maintenance.
  However, most existing anomaly detection methods are designed for either univariate
  or single-system multivariate data, making them insufficient for these complex scenarios.
  To address this, we introduce M$^2$AD, a framework for unsupervised anomaly detection
  in multivariate time series data from multiple systems. M$^2$AD employs deep models
  to capture expected behavior under normal conditions, using the residuals as indicators
  of potential anomalies. These residuals are then aggregated into a global anomaly
  score through a Gaussian Mixture Model and Gamma calibration. We theoretically demonstrate
  that this framework can effectively address heterogeneity and dependencies across
  sensors and systems. Empirically, M$^2$AD outperforms existing methods in extensive
  evaluations by 21% on average, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a large-scale
  real-world case study on 130 assets in Amazon Fulfillment Centers. Our code and
  results are available at \url{https://github.com/sarahmish/M2AD.}
