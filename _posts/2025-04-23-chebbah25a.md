abstract: " Entropy maximization and free energy minimization are general physics
  principles for modeling dynamic systems. Notable examples include modeling decision-making
  within the brain using the free-energy principle, optimizing the accuracy-complexity
  trade-off when accessing hidden variables with the information bottleneck principle
  (Tishby et al. 2000), and navigation in random environments using information maximization
  (Vergassola et al. 2007). Building on this principle, we propose a new class of
  bandit algorithms that maximize an approximation to the information of a key variable
  within the system. To this end, we develop an approximated, analytical physics-based
  representation of the entropy to forecast the information gain of each action and
  greedily choose the one with the largest information gain. This method yields strong
  performances in classical bandit settings. Motivated by its empirical success, we
  prove its asymptotic optimality for the multi-armed bandit problem with Gaussian
  rewards. Since it encompasses the systemâ€™s properties in a single, global functional,
  this approach can be efficiently adapted to more complex bandit settings. This calls
  for further investigation of information maximization approaches for multi-armed
  bandit problems. "
