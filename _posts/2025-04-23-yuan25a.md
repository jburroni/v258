title: Proximal Sampler with Adaptive Step Size
software: https://github.com/BoYuanVisionary/AdaptiveSampling
openreview: DJZlkYL9Jb
abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a target unnormalized distribution
  $\exp(-f(x))$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $f(x)$ is smooth, but the smoothness
  parameter is unknown. As a key design parameter of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  algorithms, the step size is crucial for the convergence guarantee. Existing non-asymptotic
  analysis on MCMC with fixed step sizes indicates that the step size heavily relies
  on global smoothness. However, this choice does not utilize the local information
  and fails when the smoothness coefficient is hard to estimate. A tuning-free algorithm
  that can adaptively update stepsize is highly desirable. In this work, we propose
  an \textbf{adaptive} proximal sampler that can utilize the local geometry to adjust
  step sizes and is guaranteed to converge to the target distribution. Experiments
  demonstrate the comparable or superior performance of our algorithm over various
  baselines.
