  Inputs for Gaussian Process Models

abstract: 'Gaussian Process (GP) models are widely utilized as surrogate models in
  scientific and engineering fields. However, standard GP models are limited to continuous
  variables due to the difficulties in establishing correlation structures for categorical
  variables. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \textbf{WE}ighted Euclidean
  distance matrices \textbf{G}aussian \textbf{P}rocess (WEGP). WEGP constructs the
  kernel function for each categorical input by estimating the Euclidean distance
  matrix (EDM) among all categorical choices of this input. The EDM is represented
  as a linear combination of several predefined base EDMs, each scaled by a positive
  weight. The weights, along with other kernel hyperparameters, are inferred using
  a fully Bayesian framework. We analyze the predictive performance of WEGP theoretically.
  Numerical experiments validate the accuracy of our GP model, and by WEGP, into Bayesian
  Optimization (BO), we achieve superior performance on both synthetic and real-world
  optimization problems. The code is available at: \url{https://github.com/pmy0124nus/WEGP.}'
