title: Noisy Low-Rank Matrix Completion via Transformed $L_1$ Regularization and its
  Theoretical Properties

abstract: This paper focuses on recovering an underlying matrix from its noisy partial
  entries, a problem commonly known as matrix completion. We delve into the investigation
  of a non-convex regularization, referred to as transformed $L_1$ (TL1), which interpolates
  between the rank and the nuclear norm of matrices through a hyper-parameter $a \in
  (0, \infty)$. While some literature adopts such regularization for matrix completion,
  it primarily addresses scenarios with uniformly missing entries and focuses on algorithmic
  advances. To fill in the gap in the current literature, we provide a comprehensive
  statistical analysis for the estimator from a TL1-regularized recovery model under
  general sampling distribution. In particular, we show that when $a$ is sufficiently
  large, the matrix recovered by the TL1-based model enjoys a convergence rate measured
  by the Frobenius norm, comparable to that of the model based on the nuclear norm,
  despite the challenges posed by the non-convexity of the TL1 regularization. When
  $a$ is small enough, we show that the rank of the estimated matrix remains a constant
  order when the true matrix is exactly low-rank. A trade-off between controlling
  the error and the rank is established through different choices of tuning parameters.
  The appealing practical performance of TL1 regularization is demonstrated through
  a simulation study that encompasses various sampling mechanisms, as well as two
  real-world applications. Additionally, the role of the hyper-parameter $a$ on the
  TL1-based model is explored via experiments to offer guidance in practical scenarios.
