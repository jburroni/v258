openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=ksUAp7YQ2v "
abstract: " We propose a novel approach for optimizing the graph ratio-cut by modeling
  the binary assignments as random variables. We provide an upper bound on the expected
  ratio-cut, as well as an unbiased estimate of its gradient, to learn the parameters
  of the assignment variables in an online setting. The clustering resulting from
  our probabilistic approach (PRCut) outperforms the Rayleigh quotient relaxation
  of the combinatorial problem, its online learning extensions, and several widely
  used methods. We demonstrate that the PRCut clustering closely aligns with the similarity
  measure and can perform as well as a supervised classifier when label-based similarities
  are provided. This novel approach can leverage out-of-the-box self-supervised representations
  to achieve competitive performance and serve as an evaluation method for the quality
  of these representations. "
