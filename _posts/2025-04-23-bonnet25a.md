abstract: " This paper addresses nonparametric estimation of nonlinear multivariate
  Hawkes processes, where the interaction functions are assumed to lie in a reproducing
  kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Motivated by applications in neuroscience, the model
  allows complex interaction functions, in order to express exciting and inhibiting
  effects, but also a combination of both (which is particularly interesting to model
  the refractory period of neurons), and considers in return that conditional intensities
  are rectified by the ReLU function. The latter feature incurs several methodological
  challenges, for which workarounds are proposed in this paper. In particular, it
  is shown that a representer theorem can be obtained for approximated versions of
  the log-likelihood and the least-squares criteria. Based on it, we propose an estimation
  method, that relies on two common approximations (of the ReLU function and of the
  integral operator). We provide a bound that controls the impact of these approximations.
  Numerical results on synthetic data confirm this fact as well as the good asymptotic
  behavior of the proposed estimator. It also shows that our method achieves a better
  performance compared to related nonparametric estimation techniques and suits neuronal
  applications. "
