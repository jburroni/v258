abstract: " Existing frameworks for evaluating and comparing generative models consider
  an offline setting, where the evaluator has access to large batches of data produced
  by the models. However, in practical scenarios, the goal is often to identify and
  select the best model using the fewest possible generated samples to minimize the
  costs of querying data from the sub-optimal models. In this work, we propose an
  online evaluation and selection framework to find the generative model that maximizes
  a standard assessment score among a group of available models. We view the task
  as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) and propose upper confidence bound (UCB) bandit algorithms
  to identify the model producing data with the best evaluation score that quantifies
  the quality and diversity of generated data. Specifically, we develop the MAB-based
  selection of generative models considering the Fr{Ã©}chet Distance (FD) and Inception
  Score (IS) metrics, resulting in the FD-UCB and IS-UCB algorithms. We prove regret
  bounds for these algorithms and present numerical results on standard image datasets.
  Our empirical results suggest the efficacy of MAB approaches for the sample-efficient
  evaluation and selection of deep generative models. The project code is available
  at \\url{https://github.com/yannxiaoyanhu/dgm-online-eval}. "
