abstract: " Estimation of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a core problem in
  causal inference with strong connections to Off-Policy Evaluation in Reinforcement
  Learning. This paper considers the problem of adaptively selecting the treatment
  allocation probability in order to improve estimation of the ATE. The majority of
  prior work on adaptive ATE estimation focus on asymptotic guarantees, and in turn
  overlooks important practical considerations such as the difficulty of learning
  the optimal treatment allocation as well as hyper-parameter selection.  Existing
  non-asymptotic methods are limited by poor empirical performance and exponential
  dependence on problem parameters.  In order to address these gaps, we propose and
  analyze the Clipped Second Moment Tracking (ClipSMT) algorithm, a variant of an
  existing algorithm with strong asymptotic optimality guarantees, and provide finite
  sample bounds on its Neyman regret. Our analysis shows that, in the superpopulation
  setting, ClipSMT achieves exponential improvements in Neyman regret on two fronts:
  improving the dependence on $T$ from $O(\\sqrt{T})$ to $O(\\log T)$, as well as
  reducing the exponential dependence on problem parameters to a polynomial dependenceâ€”although
  the setting we consider is slightly less general. We conclude with simulations which
  show the marked improvement of ClipSMT over existing approaches. "
