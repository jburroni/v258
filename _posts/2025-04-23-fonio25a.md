title: Hyperbolic Prototypical Entailment Cones for Image Classification
software: https://github.com/samuelefonio/HPEC
openreview: bHHk0288T8
abstract: Non-Euclidean geometries have garnered significant research interest, particularly
  in their application to Deep Learning. Utilizing specific manifolds as embedding
  spaces has been shown to enhance neural network representational capabilities by
  aligning these spaces with the data’s latent structure. In this paper, we focus
  on hyperbolic manifolds and introduce a novel framework, Hyperbolic Prototypical
  Entailment Cones (HPEC). The core innovation of HPEC lies in utilizing angular relationships,
  rather than traditional distance metrics, to more effectively capture the similarity
  between data representations and their corresponding prototypes. This is achieved
  by leveraging hyperbolic entailment cones, a mathematical construct particularly
  suited for embedding hierarchical structures in the Poincare’ Ball, along with a
  novel Backclip mechanism. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach
  significantly enhances performance in high-dimensional embedding spaces. To substantiate
  these findings, we evaluate HPEC on four diverse datasets across various embedding
  dimensions, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods in Prototype Learning.
