abstract: " We introduce a new approach to processing complex-valued data using DNNs
  consisting of parallel real-valued subnetworks with coupled outputs. Our proposed
  class of architectures, referred to as Steinmetz Neural Networks, incorporates multi-view
  learning to construct more interpretable representations in the latent space. Moreover,
  we present the Analytic Neural Network, which incorporates a consistency penalty
  that encourages analytic signal representations in the latent space of the Steinmetz
  neural network. This penalty enforces a deterministic and orthogonal relationship
  between the real and imaginary components. Using an information-theoretic construction,
  we demonstrate that the generalization gap upper bound posited by the analytic neural
  network is lower than that of the general class of Steinmetz neural networks. Our
  numerical experiments depict the improved performance and robustness to additive
  noise, afforded by our proposed networks on benchmark datasets and synthetic examples. "
