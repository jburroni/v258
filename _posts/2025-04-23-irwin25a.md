title: SemlaFlow – Efficient 3D Molecular Generation with Latent Attention and Equivariant
  Flow Matching
software: https://github.com/rssrwn/semla-flow
openreview: bee2G6pEh0
abstract: Methods for jointly generating molecular graphs along with their 3D conformations
  have gained prominence recently due to their potential impact on structure-based
  drug design. Current approaches, however, often suffer from very slow sampling times
  or generate molecules with poor chemical validity. Addressing these limitations,
  we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further
  introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained
  using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types,
  coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art
  results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to
  a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight
  limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark
  metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics,
  we compare our model’s ability to generate high quality samples against current
  approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow’s strong performance.
