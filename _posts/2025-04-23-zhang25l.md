title: Personalizing Low-Rank Bayesian Neural Networks Via Federated Learning
software: https://github.com/Bernie0115/LR-BPFL
openreview: P6vBRODemn
abstract: To support real-world decision-making, it is crucial for models to be well-calibrated,
  i.e., to assign reliable confidence estimates to their predictions. Uncertainty
  quantification is particularly important in personalized federated learning (PFL),
  as participating clients typically have small local datasets, making it difficult
  to unambiguously determine optimal model parameters. Bayesian PFL (BPFL) methods
  can potentially enhance calibration, but they often come with considerable computational
  and memory requirements due to the need to track the variances of all the individual
  model parameters. Furthermore, different clients may exhibit heterogeneous uncertainty
  levels owing to varying local dataset sizes and distributions. To address these
  challenges, we propose LR-BPFL, a novel BPFL method that learns a global deterministic
  model along with personalized low-rank Bayesian corrections. To tailor the local
  model to each clientâ€™s inherent uncertainty level, LR-BPFL incorporates an adaptive
  rank selection mechanism. We evaluate LR-BPFL across a variety of datasets, demonstrating
  its advantages in terms of calibration, accuracy, as well as computational and memory
  requirements. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Bernie0115/LR-BPFL.}
