title: Multimodal Learning with Uncertainty Quantification based on Discounted Belief
  Fusion
software: https://github.com/bezirganyan/DBF_uncertainty
openreview: Y502d7Ci4U
abstract: Multimodal AI models are increasingly used in fields like healthcare, finance,
  and autonomous driving, where information is drawn from multiple sources or modalities
  such as images, texts, audios, videos. However, effectively managing uncertainty—arising
  from noise, insufficient evidence, or conflicts between modalities—is crucial for
  reliable decision-making. Current uncertainty-aware machine learning methods leveraging,
  for example, evidence averaging, or evidence accumulation underestimate uncertainties
  in high-conflict scenarios. Moreover, the state-of-the-art evidence averaging strategy
  is not order invariant and fails to scale to multiple modalities. To address these
  challenges, we propose a novel multimodal learning method with order-invariant evidence
  fusion and introduce a conflict-based discounting mechanism that reallocates uncertain
  mass when unreliable modalities are detected. We provide both theoretical analysis
  and experimental validation, demonstrating that unlike the previous work, the proposed
  approach effectively distinguishes between conflicting and non-conflicting samples
  based on the provided uncertainty estimates, and outperforms the previous models
  in uncertainty-based conflict detection.
