abstract: " Spectral estimators are fundamental in low-rank matrix models and arise
  throughout machine learning and statistics, with applications including network
  analysis, matrix completion and PCA. These estimators aim to recover the leading
  eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an unknown signal matrix observed subject to noise.
  While extensive research has addressed the statistical accuracy of spectral estimators
  under a variety of conditions, most previous work has assumed that the signal eigenvectors
  are incoherent with respect to the standard basis. This assumption typically arises
  because of suboptimal dependence on coherence in one or more concentration inequalities.
  Using a new matrix concentration result that may be of independent interest, we
  establish estimation error bounds for eigenvector and eigenvalue recovery whose
  dependence on coherence significantly improves upon prior work. Our results imply
  that coherence-free bounds can be achieved when the standard deviation of the noise
  is comparable to its Orlicz 1-norm (i.e., its subexponential norm). This matches
  known minimax lower bounds under Gaussian noise up to logarithmic factors. "
