title: " Memory-Efficient Optimization with Factorized Hamiltonian Descent "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=2soEM2biI3 "
abstract: " Modern deep learning heavily depends on adaptive optimizers such as Adam
  and its variants, which are renowned for their capacity to handle model scaling
  and streamline hyperparameter tuning. However, these algorithms typically experience
  high memory overhead caused by the accumulation of optimization states, leading
  to a critical challenge in training large-scale network models. In this study, we
  introduce a novel adaptive optimizer, H-Fac, which incorporates a memory-efficient
  factorization approach to address this challenge. By employing a rank-1 parameterization
  for both momentum and scaling parameter estimators, H-Fac reduces memory costs to
  a sublinear level while maintaining competitive performance across a wide range
  of architectures. We develop our algorithms based on principles derived from Hamiltonian
  dynamics, providing robust theoretical underpinnings in optimization dynamics and
  convergence guarantees. These optimization algorithms are designed to be both straightforward
  and adaptable, facilitating easy implementation in diverse settings. "
