title: Locally Private Estimation with Public Features
openreview: 4fhFayxBO5
abstract: We initiate the study of locally differentially private (LDP) learning with
  public features. We define semi-feature LDP, where some features are publicly available
  while the remaining ones, along with the label, require protection under local differential
  privacy. Under semi-feature LDP, we demonstrate that the mini-max convergence rate
  for non-parametric regression is significantly reduced compared to that of classical
  LDP. Then we propose HistOfTree, an estimator that fully leverages the information
  contained in both public and private features. Theoretically, HistOfTree reaches
  the mini-max optimal convergence rate. Empirically, HistOfTree achieves superior
  performance on both synthetic and real data. We also explore scenarios where users
  have the flexibility to select features for protection manually. In such cases,
  we propose an estimator and a data-driven parameter tuning strategy, leading to
  analogous theoretical and empirical results.
