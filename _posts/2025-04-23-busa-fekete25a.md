title: " Near-optimal algorithms for private estimation and sequential testing of
  collision probability "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=Gz4mw5xWUi "
abstract: " We present new algorithms for estimating and testing \\emph{collision
  probability}, a fundamental measure of the spread of a discrete distribution that
  is widely used in many scientific fields. We describe an algorithm that satisfies
  $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-local differential privacy and estimates collision probability
  with error at most $\\epsilon$ using $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{\\log(1/\\beta)}{\\alpha^2
  \\epsilon^2}\\right)$ samples for $\\alpha \\le 1$, which improves over previous
  work by a factor of $\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}$. We also present a sequential testing
  algorithm for collision probability, which can distinguish between collision probability
  values that are separated by $\\epsilon$ using $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$
  samples, even when $\\epsilon$ is unknown. Our algorithms have nearly the optimal
  sample complexity, and in experiments we show that they require significantly fewer
  samples than previous methods. "
