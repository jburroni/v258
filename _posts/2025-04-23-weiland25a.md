abstract: Mechanistic knowledge about the physical world is virtually always expressed
  via partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a surge of interest
  in probabilistic PDE solvers—Bayesian statistical models mostly based on Gaussian
  process (GP) priors which seamlessly combine empirical measurements and mechanistic
  knowledge. As such, they quantify uncertainties arising from e.g. noisy or missing
  data, unknown PDE parameters or discretization error by design. Prior work has established
  connections to classical PDE solvers and provided solid theoretical guarantees.
  However, scaling such methods to large-scale problems remains a fundamental challenge
  primarily due to dense covariance matrices. Our approach addresses the scalability
  issues by leveraging the Markov property of many commonly used GP priors. It has
  been shown that such priors are solutions to stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) which when
  discretized allow for highly efficient GP regression through sparse linear algebra.
  In this work, we show how to leverage this prior class to make probabilistic PDE
  solvers practical, even for large-scale nonlinear PDEs, through greatly accelerated
  inference mechanisms. Additionally, our approach also allows for flexible and physically
  meaningful priors beyond what can be modeled with covariance functions. Experiments
  confirm substantial speedups and accelerated convergence of our physics-informed
  priors in nonlinear settings.
