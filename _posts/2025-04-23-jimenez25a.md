abstract: " For regression tasks, standard Gaussian processes (GPs) provide natural
  uncertainty quantification (UQ), while deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at representation
  learning. Deterministic UQ methods for neural networks have successfully combined
  the two and require only a single pass through the neural network. However, current
  methods necessitate changes to network training to address feature collapse, where
  unique inputs map to identical feature vectors. We propose an alternative solution,
  the deep Vecchia ensemble (DVE), which allows deterministic UQ to work in the presence
  of feature collapse, negating the need for network retraining. DVE comprises an
  ensemble of GPs built on hidden-layer outputs of a DNN, achieving scalability via
  Vecchia approximations that leverage nearest-neighbor conditional independence.
  DVE is compatible with pretrained networks and incurs low computational overhead.
  We demonstrate DVEâ€™s utility on several datasets and carry out experiments to understand
  the inner workings of the proposed method. "
