title: On the Geometry and Optimization of Polynomial Convolutional Networks
openreview: FdYA56Gcsj
abstract: We study convolutional neural networks with monomial activation functions.
  Specifically, we prove that their parameterization map is regular and is an isomorphism
  almost everywhere, up to rescaling the filters. By leveraging on tools from algebraic
  geometry, we explore the geometric properties of the image in function space of
  this map – typically referred to as neuromanifold. In particular, we compute the
  dimension and the degree of the neuromanifold, which measure the expressivity of
  the model, and describe its singularities. Moreover, for a generic large dataset,
  we derive an explicit formula that quantifies the number of critical points arising
  in the optimization of a regression loss.
