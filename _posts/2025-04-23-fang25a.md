abstract: " Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is an essential technique in multivariate
  analysis, with Weighted MDS (WMDS) commonly employed for tasks such as dimensionality
  reduction and graph drawing. However, the optimization of WMDS poses significant
  challenges due to the highly non-convex nature of its objective function. Stress
  Majorization, a method classified under the Majorization-Minimization algorithm,
  is among the most widely used solvers for this problem because it guarantees non-increasing
  loss values during optimization, even with a non-convex objective function. Despite
  this advantage, Stress Majorization suffers from high computational complexity,
  specifically $\\mathcal{O}(\\max(n^3, n^2 p))$ per iteration, where $n$ denotes
  the number of data points, and $p$ represents the projection dimension, rendering
  it impractical for large-scale data analysis. To mitigate the computational challenge,
  we introduce StableMDS, a novel gradient descent-based method that reduces the computational
  complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 p)$ per iteration. StableMDS achieves this computational
  efficiency by applying gradient descent independently to each point, thereby eliminating
  the need for costly matrix operations inherent in Stress Majorization. Furthermore,
  we theoretically ensure non-increasing loss values and optimization stability akin
  to Stress Majorization. These advancements not only enhance computational efficiency
  but also maintain stability, thereby broadening the applicability of WMDS to larger
  datasets. "
