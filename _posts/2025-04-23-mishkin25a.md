abstract: " We study level set teleportation, an optimization routine which tries
  to accelerate gradient descent (GD) by maximizing the gradient norm over a level
  set of the objective. While teleportation intuitively speeds-up GD via bigger steps,
  current work lacks convergence theory for convex functions, guarantees for solving
  the teleportation operator, and even clear empirical evidence showing this acceleration.
  We resolve these open questions. For convex functions satisfying Hessian stability,
  we prove that GD with teleportation obtains a combined sub-linear/linear convergence
  rate which is strictly faster than GD when the optimality gap is small. This is
  in sharp contrast to the standard (strongly) convex setting, where teleportation
  neither improves nor worsens convergence. To evaluate teleportation in practice,
  we develop a projected-gradient method requiring only Hessian-vector products. We
  use this to show that gradient methods with access to a teleportation oracle out-perform
  their standard versions on a variety of problems. We also find that GD with teleportation
  is faster than truncated Newton methods, particularly for non-convex optimization. "
