title: Recurrent Neural Goodness-of-Fit Test for Time Series

abstract: Time series data are crucial across diverse domains such as finance and
  healthcare, where accurate forecasting and decision-making rely on advanced modeling
  techniques. While generative models have shown great promise in capturing the intricate
  dynamics inherent in time series, evaluating their performance remains a major challenge.
  Traditional evaluation metrics fall short due to the temporal dependencies and potential
  high dimensionality of the features. In this paper, we propose the REcurrent NeurAL
  (RENAL) Goodness-of-Fit test, a novel and statistically rigorous framework for evaluating
  generative time series models. By leveraging recurrent neural networks, we transform
  the time series into conditionally independent data pairs, enabling the application
  of a chi-square-based goodness-of-fit test to the temporal dependencies within the
  data. This approach offers a robust, theoretically grounded solution for assessing
  the quality of generative models, particularly in settings with limited time sequences.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets,
  outperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method
  fills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models, offering
  a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes applications.
