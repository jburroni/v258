title: " Implicit Diffusion: Efficient optimization through stochastic sampling "
software: " https://github.com/google-deepmind/implicit_diffusion "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=r5F7Z8s0Qk "
abstract: " Sampling and automatic differentiation are both ubiquitous in modern machine
  learning. At its intersection, differentiating through a sampling operation, with
  respect to the parameters of the sampling process, is a problem that is both challenging
  and broadly applicable. We introduce a general framework and a new algorithm for
  first-order optimization of parameterized stochastic diffusions, performing jointly,
  in a single loop, optimization and sampling steps. This approach is inspired by
  recent advances in bilevel optimization and automatic implicit differentiation,
  leveraging the point of view of sampling as optimization over the space of probability
  distributions. We provide theoretical and experimental results showcasing the performance
  of our method. "
