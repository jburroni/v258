title: 'Bridging Multiple Worlds: Multi-marginal Optimal Transport for Causal Partial-identification
  Problem'
software: https://github.com/ShuGe-MIT/mot_project
openreview: h2WIiouJEm
abstract: Under the prevalent potential outcome model in causal inference, each unit
  is associated with multiple potential outcomes but at most one of which is observed,
  leading to many causal quantities being only partially identified. The inherent
  missing data issue echoes the multi-marginal optimal transport (MOT) problem, where
  marginal distributions are known, but how the marginals couple to form the joint
  distribution is unavailable. In this paper, we cast the causal partial identification
  problem in the framework of MOT with $K$ margins and $d$-dimensional outcomes and
  obtain the exact partial identified set. In order to estimate the partial identified
  set via MOT, statistically, we establish a convergence rate of the plug-in MOT estimator
  for the $\ell_2$ cost function stemming from the variance minimization problem and
  prove it is minimax optimal for arbitrary $K$ and $d \le 4$. We also extend the
  convergence result to general quadratic objective functions. Numerically, we demonstrate
  the efficacy of our method over synthetic datasets and several real-world datasets
  where our proposal consistently outperforms the baseline by a significant margin
  (over 70%). In addition, we provide efficient off-the-shelf implementations of MOT
  with general objective functions.
