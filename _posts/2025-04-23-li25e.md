title: Multi-Agent Credit Assignment with Pretrained Language Models
software: https://github.com/ewanlee/SAMA
openreview: 2kIYWdFU0x
abstract: The difficulty of appropriately assigning credit is particularly heightened
  in cooperative MARL with sparse reward, due to the concurrent time and structural
  scales involved. Automatic subgoal generation (ASG) has recently emerged as a viable
  MARL approach inspired by utilizing subgoals in intrinsically motivated reinforcement
  learning. However, end-to-end learning of complex task planning from sparse rewards
  without prior knowledge, undoubtedly requires massive training samples. Moreover,
  the diversity-promoting nature of existing ASG methods can lead to the "over-representation"
  of subgoals, generating numerous spurious subgoals of limited relevance to the actual
  task reward and thus decreasing the sample efficiency of the algorithm. To address
  this problem and inspired by the disentangled representation learning, we propose
  a novel "disentangled" decision-making method, Semantically Aligned task decomposition
  in MARL (SAMA), that prompts pretrained language models with chain-of-thought that
  can suggest potential goals, provide suitable goal decomposition and subgoal allocation
  as well as self-reflection-based replanning. Additionally, SAMA incorporates language-grounded
  MARL to train each agentâ€™s subgoal-conditioned policy. SAMA demonstrates considerable
  advantages in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art ASG methods, as evidenced
  by its performance on two challenging sparse-reward tasks, Overcooked and MiniRTS.
