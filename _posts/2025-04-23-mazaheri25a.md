title: Synthetic Potential Outcomes and Causal Mixture Identifiability

openreview: J1CJaSnmKg
abstract: Heterogeneous data from multiple populations, sub-groups, or sources can
  be represented as a "mixture model" with a single latent class influencing all of
  the observed covariates. Heterogeneity can be resolved at different levels by grouping
  populations according to different notions of similarity. This paper proposes grouping
  with respect to the causal response of an intervention or perturbation on the system.
  This is distinct from previous notions, such as grouping by similar covariate values
  (e.g., clustering) or similar correlations between covariates (e.g., Gaussian mixture
  models). To solve the problem, we "synthetically sample" from a counterfactual distribution
  using higher-order multi-linear moments of the observable data. To understand how
  these “causal mixtures” fit in with more classical notions, we develop a hierarchy
  of mixture identifiability.
