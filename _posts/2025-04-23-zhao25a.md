abstract: " This paper addresses the optimization problem of minimizing non-convex
  continuous functions, a problem highly relevant in high-dimensional machine learning
  scenarios, particularly those involving over-parameterization. We analyze a randomized
  coordinate second-order method named SSCN, which can be interpreted as applying
  the cubic regularization of Newton’s method in random subspaces. This approach effectively
  reduces the computational complexity associated with utilizing second-order information,
  making it applicable in higher-dimensional scenarios. Theoretically, we establish
  strong global convergence guarantees for non-convex functions to a stationary point,
  with interpolating rates for arbitrary subspace sizes and allowing inexact curvature
  estimation, starting from an arbitrary initialization. When increasing the subspace
  size, our complexity matches the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$  rate of the full
  Newton’s method with cubic regularization. Additionally, we propose an adaptive
  sampling scheme ensuring the exact convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3/2},
  \\epsilon^{-3})$ to a second-order stationary point, without requiring to sample
  all coordinates. Experimental results demonstrate substantial speed-ups achieved
  by SSCN  compared to conventional first-order methods and other second-order subspace
  methods. "
