title: Nyström Kernel Stein Discrepancy
software: https://github.com/FlopsKa/nystroem-ksd
openreview: iLM3CeY2zb
abstract: Kernel methods underpin many of the most successful approaches in data science
  and statistics, and they allow representing probability measures as elements of
  a reproducing kernel Hilbert space without loss of information. Recently, the kernel
  Stein discrepancy (KSD), which combines Stein’s method with the flexibility of kernel
  techniques, gained considerable attention. Through the Stein operator, KSD allows
  the construction of powerful goodness-of-fit tests where it is sufficient to know
  the target distribution up to a multiplicative constant. However, the typical U-
  and V-statistic-based KSD estimators suffer from a quadratic runtime complexity,
  which hinders their application in large-scale settings. In this work, we propose
  a Nystr{ö}m-based KSD acceleration—with runtime $\mathcal{O} \left(mn+m^3\right)$
  for $n$ samples and $m\ll n$ Nystr{ö}m points—, show its $\sqrt{n}$-consistency
  with a classical sub-Gaussian assumption, and demonstrate its applicability for
  goodness-of-fit testing on a suite of benchmarks. We also show the $\sqrt n$-consistency
  of the quadratic-time KSD estimator.
