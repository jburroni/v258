title: Credibility-Aware Multimodal Fusion Using Probabilistic Circuits
software: https://github.com/Pranuthi23/Credibility_MultimodalData
openreview: DuUFmnvbND
abstract: We consider the problem of late multimodal fusion for discriminative learning.
  Motivated by noisy, multi-source domains that require understanding the reliability
  of each data source, we explore the notion of credibility in the context of multimodal
  fusion. We propose a combination function that uses probabilistic circuits (PCs)
  to combine predictive distributions over individual modalities. We also define a
  probabilistic measure to evaluate the credibility of each modality via inference
  queries over the PC. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our fusion method
  can reliably infer credibility while being competitive with the state-of-the-art.
