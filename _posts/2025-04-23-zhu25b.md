abstract: " The partial alignment and conflict of autonomous agents lead to mixed-motive
  scenarios in many real-world applications. However, agents may fail to cooperate
  in practice even when cooperation yields a better outcome. One well known reason
  for this failure comes from non-credible commitments. To facilitate commitments
  among agents for better cooperation, we define Markov Commitment Games (MCGs), a
  variant of commitment games, where agents can voluntarily commit to their proposed
  future plans. Based on MCGs, we propose a learnable commitment protocol via policy
  gradients. We further propose incentive-compatible learning to accelerate convergence
  to equilibria with better social welfare. Experimental results in challenging mixed-motive
  tasks demonstrate faster empirical convergence and higher returns for our method
  compared with its counterparts. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/shuhui-zhu/DCL.} "
