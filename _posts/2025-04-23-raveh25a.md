abstract: Fine-tuning large deep networks with preference-based human feedback has
  seen promising results. As user numbers grow and tasks shift to complex datasets
  like images or videos, distributed approaches become essential for efficiently gathering
  feedback.  To address this, we introduce a multiplayer dueling bandit problem, highlighting
  that exploring non-informative candidate pairs becomes especially challenging in
  a collaborative environment. We demonstrate that the use of a Follow Your Leader
  black-box approach matches the asymptotic regret lower-bound when utilizing known
  dueling bandit algorithms as a foundation. Additionally, we propose and analyze
  a message-passing fully distributed approach with a novel Condorcet-Winner recommendation
  protocol, resulting in expedited exploration in the non-asymptotic regime which
  reduces regret. Our experimental comparisons reveal that our multiplayer algorithms
  surpass single-player benchmark algorithms, underscoring their efficacy in addressing
  the nuanced challenges of this setting.
