title: Neural Point Processes for Pixel-wise Regression
software: https://github.com/neu-spiral/Neural-Point-Processes
openreview: NzFxCmpTSt
abstract: 'We study pixel-wise regression problems with sparsely annotated images.
  Traditional regression methods based on mean squared error emphasize pixels with
  labels, leading to distorted predictions in unlabeled areas. To address this limitation,
  we introduce Neural Point Processes, a novel approach that combines 2D Gaussian
  Processes with neural networks to leverage spatial correlations between sparse labels
  on images. This approach offers two key advantages: it imposes smoothness constraints
  on the model output and enables conditional predictions when sparse labels are available
  at inference time. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
  a substantial improvement in mean-squared error and $R^2$ scores, outperforming
  standard regression techniques. On the real-world dataset COWC, we achieve an $R^2$
  of $0.769$ with $81$ out of $40,000$ ($0.2$%) points labeled, while standard regression
  loss (MSE) results in an $R^2$ of $0.060$.'
