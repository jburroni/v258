title: 'SNAP: Sequential Non-Ancestor Pruning for Targeted Causal Effect Estimation
  With an Unknown Graph'
software: https://github.com/Matyasch/snap
openreview: 0gEjlLdjK9
abstract: Causal discovery can be computationally demanding for large numbers of variables.  If
  we only wish to estimate the causal effects on a small subset of target variables,
  we might not need to learn the causal graph for all variables, but only a small
  subgraph that includes the targets and their adjustment sets.  In this paper, we
  focus on identifying causal effects between target variables in a computationally
  and statistically efficient way. This task combines causal discovery and effect
  estimation, aligning the discovery objective with the effects to be estimated. We
  show that definite non-ancestors of the targets are unnecessary to learn causal
  relations between the targets and to identify efficient adjustments sets. We sequentially
  identify and prune these definite non-ancestors with our Sequential Non-Ancestor
  Pruning (SNAP) framework, which can be used either as a preprocessing step to standard
  causal discovery methods, or as a standalone sound and complete causal discovery
  algorithm. Our results on synthetic and real data show that both approaches substantially
  reduce the number of independence tests and the computation time without compromising
  the quality of causal effect estimations.
