title: Robust Classification by Coupling Data Mollification with Label Smoothing
software: https://github.com/markusheinonen/supervised-mollification
openreview: ObNPRUia5P
abstract: Introducing training-time augmentations is a key technique to enhance generalization
  and prepare deep neural networks against test-time corruptions. Inspired by the
  success of generative diffusion models, we propose a novel approach of coupling
  data mollification, in the form of image noising and blurring, with label smoothing
  to align predicted label confidences with image degradation. The method is simple
  to implement, introduces negligible overheads, and can be combined with existing
  augmentations. We demonstrate improved robustness and uncertainty quantification
  on the corrupted image benchmarks of CIFAR, TinyImageNet and ImageNet datasets.
