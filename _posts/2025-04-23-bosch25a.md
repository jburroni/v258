title: A Novel Convex Gaussian Min Max Theorem for Repeated Features
openreview: T2FJaLgM4r
abstract: The Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT) allows for the study of min-max
  optimization problems over bilinear Gaussian forms by instead considering an alternative
  optimization problem whose statistical properties are tied to that of the primary
  optimization. We prove a generalization of the CGMT to a family of problems in machine
  learning (ML) with correlated entries in the data matrix. This family includes various
  familiar examples of problems with shared weights or repeated features. In particular,
  we make use of our theorem to obtain asymptotically exact learning curves for regression
  with vector valued labels, regression with complex variables, and regression with
  convolution.
