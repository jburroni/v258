title: Computing high-dimensional optimal transport by flow neural networks
software: https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/FlowOT
openreview: oEWYNesvRJ
abstract: Computing optimal transport (OT) for general high-dimensional data has been
  a long-standing challenge. Despite much progress, most of the efforts including
  neural network methods have been focused on the static formulation of the OT problem.
  The current work proposes to compute the dynamic OT between two arbitrary distributions
  $P$ and $Q$ by optimizing a flow model, where both distributions are only accessible
  via finite samples. Our method learns the dynamic OT by finding an invertible flow
  that minimizes the transport cost. The trained optimal transport flow subsequently
  allows for performing many downstream tasks, including infinitesimal density ratio
  estimation (DRE) and domain adaptation by interpolating distributions in the latent
  space. The effectiveness of the proposed model on high-dimensional data is demonstrated
  by strong empirical performance on OT baselines, image-to-image translation, and
  high-dimensional DRE.
