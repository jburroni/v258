title: 'Permutation Invariant Functions: Statistical Testing, Density Estimation,
  and Metric Entropy'
openreview: 6HWDypPncm
abstract: 'Permutation invariance is among the most common symmetries that can be
  exploited to simplify complex problems in machine learning. There has been a tremendous
  surge of research activities in building permutation invariant machine learning
  architectures. However, less attention is given to: (1) how to statistically test
  for the assumption of permutation invariance of coordinates in a random vector where
  the dimension is allowed to grow with the sample size; (2) how to estimate permutation
  invariant density functions; (3) how much “smaller” is the class of smooth functions
  with permutation invariance compared to that without permutation invariance. In
  this paper, we take a step back and examine these fundamental questions. In particular,
  our testing method is based on a sorting trick, and our estimation method is based
  on an averaging trick. These tricks substantially simplify the exploitation of permutation
  invariance. We also analyze the metric entropy of permutation invariant function
  classes and compare them with their counterparts without imposing permutation invariance.'
