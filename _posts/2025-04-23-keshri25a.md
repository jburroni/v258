abstract: " The holy grail of machine learning is to enable Continual Federated Learning
  (CFL) to enhance the efficiency, privacy, and scalability of AI systems while learning
  from streaming data. The primary challenge of a CFL system is to overcome global
  catastrophic forgetting, wherein the accuracy of the global model trained on new
  tasks declines on the old tasks. In this work, we propose \\emph{Continual Federated
  Learning with Aggregated Gradients} (C-FLAG), a novel replay-memory based federated
  strategy consisting of edge-based gradient updates on memory and aggregated gradients
  on the current data. We provide convergence analysis of the C-FLAG approach which
  addresses forgetting and bias while converging at a rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ over
  $T$ communication rounds. We formulate an optimization sub-problem that minimizes
  catastrophic forgetting, translating CFL into an iterative algorithm with adaptive
  learning rates that ensure seamless learning across tasks. We empirically show that
  C-FLAG outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on both task and class-incremental
  settings with respect to metrics such as accuracy and forgetting. "
