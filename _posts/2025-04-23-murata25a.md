title: Clustered Invariant Risk Minimization
openreview: ou8tQ1jmQJ
abstract: This study extends the problem settings of Invariant Risk Minimization(IRM)
  for Out-of-Distribution generalization problems to unknown clustered environments
  settings. In this scenario, where a given set of environments exhibits an unknown
  clustered structure, our objective is to identify a single invariant feature extractor
  and per-cluster regressors (or classifiers) built on top of the feature extractor.
  To achieve this, we propose a new framework called Clustered IRM for simultaneously
  identifying the cluster structure and the invariant features. Our theoretical analysis
  demonstrates that the required number of training environments for such identification
  is only $O(d_\mathrm{sp} + K^2)$, where $d_\mathrm{sp}$ represents the dimensionality
  of the spurious features, and $K$ is the number of clusters. Numerical experiments
  validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.
