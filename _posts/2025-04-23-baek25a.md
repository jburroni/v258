title: Theory of Agreement-on-the-Line in Linear Models and Gaussian Data
openreview: cUTzrd9mIA
abstract: 'Under distribution shifts, deep networks exhibit a surprising phenomenon:
  in-distribution (ID) versus out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy is often strongly
  linearly correlated across architectures and hyperparameters, accompanied by the
  same linear trend in ID versus OOD agreement between the predictions of any pair
  of such independently trained networks. The latter phenomenon called “agreement-on-the-line”
  enables precise unlabeled OOD performance estimation of models. In this work, we
  discover that agreement-on-the-line emerges even in linear classifiers over Gaussian
  class conditional distributions. We provide theoretical guarantees for this phenomenon
  in classifiers optimized via randomly initialized gradient descent, approximated
  by linear interpolations between random vectors and the Bayes-optimal classifier.
  Next, we prove a lower bound on the residual of the correlation between ID versus
  OOD agreement that grows proportionally with the residual of accuracy. Real-world
  experiments on CIFAR10C shifts, validate our findings and the broader relevance
  of our theoretical framework.'
