title: " Corruption Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=AM5VTtoexY "
abstract: " We study data corruption robustness for reinforcement learning with human
  feedback (RLHF) in an offline setting. Given an offline dataset of pairs of trajectories
  along with feedback about human preferences, an  $\\varepsilon$-fraction of the
  pairs is corrupted (e.g., feedback flipped or trajectory features manipulated),
  capturing an adversarial attack or noisy human preferences. We aim to design algorithms
  that identify a near-optimal policy from the corrupted data, with provable guarantees.
  Existing theoretical works have separately studied the settings of corruption robust
  RL (learning from scalar rewards directly under corruption) and offline RLHF (learning
  from human feedback without corruption); however, they are inapplicable to our problem
  of dealing with corrupted data in offline RLHF setting. To this end, we design novel
  corruption robust offline RLHF methods under various assumptions on the coverage
  of the data-generating distributions. At a high level, our methodology robustifies
  an offline RLHF framework by first learning a reward model along with confidence
  sets and then learning a pessimistic optimal policy over the confidence set. Our
  key insight is that learning optimal policy can be done by leveraging an offline
  corruption-robust RL oracle in different ways (e.g., zero-order oracle or first-order
  oracle), depending on the data coverage assumptions. To our knowledge, ours is the
  first work that provides provable corruption robust offline RLHF methods. "
