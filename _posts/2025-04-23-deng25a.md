title: " Stochastic Compositional Minimax Optimization with Provable Convergence Guarantees "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=0Pl4libZsC "
abstract: " Stochastic compositional minimax problems are prevalent in machine learning,
  yet there exist only limited established findings on the convergence of this class
  of problems. In this paper, we propose a formal definition of the stochastic compositional
  minimax problem, which involves optimizing a minimax loss with a compositional structure
  either in primal, dual, or both primal and dual variables. We introduce a simple
  yet effective algorithm, stochastically Corrected stOchastic gradient Descent Ascent
  (CODA), which is a primal-dual type algorithm with compositional correction steps,
  and establish its convergence rate in the aforementioned three settings. We also
  propose a variance reduced variant, CODA+, which achieves the best-known rate on
  nonconvex-strongly-concave and nonconvex-concave compositional minimax problems.
  This work initiates the theoretical study of the stochastic compositional minimax
  problem in various settings and may inform modern machine learning scenarios such
  as domain adaptation or robust model-agnostic meta-learning. "
