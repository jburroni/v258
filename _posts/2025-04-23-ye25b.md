abstract: " In real-world applications of large language models, outputs are often
  required to be confined: selecting items from predefined product or document sets,
  generating phrases that comply with safety standards, or conforming to specialized
  formatting styles. To control the generation, constrained decoding has been widely
  adopted. However, existing prefix-tree-based constrained decoding is inefficient
  under GPU-based model inference paradigms, and it introduces unintended biases into
  the output distribution. This paper introduces Dynamic Importance Sampling for Constrained
  Decoding (DISC) with GPU-based Parallel Prefix-Verification (PPV), a novel algorithm
  that leverages dynamic importance sampling to achieve theoretically guaranteed asymptotic
  unbiasedness and overcomes the inefficiency of prefix-tree. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods in both efficiency
  and output quality. These results highlight the potential of our methods to improve
  constrained generation in applications where adherence to specific constraints is
  essential. "
