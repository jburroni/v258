title: Diffusion Models under Group Transformations
openreview: TxYNVSoAz4
abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have become the leading approach for distribution
  learning. This paper focuses on structure-preserving diffusion models (SPDM), a
  specific subset of diffusion processes tailored for distributions with inherent
  structures, such as group symmetries. We complement existing sufficient conditions
  for constructing SPDMs by proving complementary necessary ones. Additionally, we
  propose a new framework that considers the geometric structures affecting the diffusion
  process. Leveraging this framework, we design a structure-preserving bridge model
  that maintains alignment between the modelâ€™s endpoint couplings. Empirical evaluations
  on equivariant diffusion models demonstrate their effectiveness in learning symmetric
  distributions and modeling transitions between them. Experiments on real-world medical
  images confirm that our models preserve equivariance while maintaining high sample
  quality. We also showcase the practical utility of our framework by implementing
  an equivariant denoising diffusion bridge model, which achieves reliable equivariant
  image noise reduction and style transfer, irrespective of prior knowledge of image
  orientation.
