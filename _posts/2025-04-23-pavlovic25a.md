title: Differentially Private Kernelized Contextual Bandits
openreview: axgerltoda
abstract: We consider the problem of contextual kernel bandits with stochastic contexts,
  where the underlying reward function belongs to a known Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
  Space (RKHS). We study this problem under the additional constraint of joint differential
  privacy, where the agents needs to ensure that the sequence of query points is differentially
  private with respect to both the sequence of contexts and rewards. We propose a
  novel algorithm that improves upon the state of the art  and achieves an error rate
  of $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\dfrac{\gamma_T}{T}} + \dfrac{\gamma_T}{T \varepsilon}\right)$
  after $T$ queries for a large class of kernel families, where $\gamma_T$ represents
  the effective dimensionality of the kernel and $\varepsilon > 0$ is the privacy
  parameter. Our results are based on novel estimator for the reward function that
  simultaneously enjoys high utility along with a low-sensitivity to observed rewards
  and contexts, which is crucial to obtain an improved performance.
