abstract: " In this paper, we present a deterministic particle-based method for global
  optimization of continuous Sobolev functions, called \\emph{Stein Boltzmann Sampling}
  (SBS). SBS initializes uniformly a number of particles representing candidate solutions,
  then uses the \\emph{Stein Variational Gradient Descent} (SVGD) algorithm to sequentially
  and deterministically move those particles in order to approximate a target distribution
  whose mass is concentrated around promising areas of the domain of the optimized
  function. The target is chosen to be a properly parametrized Boltzmann distribution.
  For the purpose of global optimization, we adapt the generic SVGD theoretical framework
  allowing to address more general target distributions over a compact subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$,
  and we prove SBS’s asymptotic convergence. In addition to the main SBS algorithm,
  we present two variants: the SBS-PF that includes a particle filtering strategy,
  and the SBS-HYBRID one that uses SBS or SBS-PF as a continuation after other particle-
  or distribution-based optimization methods. A detailed comparison with state-of-the-art
  methods on benchmark functions demonstrates that SBS and its variants are highly
  competitive, while the combination of the two variants provides the best trade-off
  between accuracy and computational cost. "
