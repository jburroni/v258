title: 'BudgetIV: Optimal Partial Identification of Causal Effects with Mostly Invalid
  Instruments'

openreview: ZHk2fqJ4tk
abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used to estimate causal effects
  in the presence of unobserved confounding between an exposure $X$ and outcome $Y$.
  An IV must affect $Y$ exclusively through $X$ and be unconfounded with $Y$. We present
  a framework for relaxing these assumptions with tuneable and interpretable "budget
  constraints". Our algorithm returns a feasible set of causal effects that can be
  identified exactly given perfect knowledge of observable covariance statistics.
  This feasible set might contain disconnected sets of possible solutions for the
  causal effect. We discuss conditions under which this set is sharp, i.e., contains
  all and only effects consistent with the background assumptions and the joint distribution
  of observable variables. Our method applies to a wide class of semiparametric models,
  and we demonstrate how its ability to select specific subsets of instruments confers
  an advantage over convex relaxations in both linear and nonlinear settings. We adapt
  our algorithm to form confidence sets that are asymptotically valid under a common
  statistical assumption from the Mendelian randomization literature. An accompanying
  R package, budgetIVr, is available from CRAN.
