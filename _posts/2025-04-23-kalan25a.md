title: Transfer Neyman-Pearson Algorithm for Outlier Detection
software: https://github.com/eneugut/transfer-learning-neyman-pearson
openreview: ULLi0X0i9s
abstract: We consider the problem of transfer learning in outlier detection where
  target abnormal data is rare. While transfer learning has been considered extensively
  in traditional classification, the problem of transfer in outlier detection and
  more generally in imbalanced classification settings has received less attention.
  We propose a general algorithmic approach which is shown theoretically to yield
  strong guarantees w.r.t. to a range of changes in abnormal distribution, and at
  the same time amenable to practical implementation. We then investigate different
  instantiations of this general algorithmic approach, e.g., based on multi-layer
  neural networks, and show empirically that they significantly outperform natural
  extensions of transfer methods from traditional classification (which are the only
  solutions available at the moment)
