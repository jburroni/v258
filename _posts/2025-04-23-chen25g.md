title: Continuous Structure Constraint Integration for Robust Causal Discovery
software: https://github.com/shamosha/ECA
openreview: 23OrwVz5d5
abstract: Causal discovery aims to infer a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) from observational
  data to represent causal relationships among variables. Traditional combinatorial
  methods search DAG spaces to identify optimal structures, while recent advances
  in continuous optimization improve this search process. However, integrating structural
  constraints informed by prior knowledge into these methods remains a substantial
  challenge. Existing methods typically integrate prior knowledge in a hard way, demanding
  precise information about causal relationships and struggling with erroneous priors.
  Such rigidity can lead to significant inaccuracies, especially when the priors are
  flawed.  In response to these challenges, this work introduces the Edge Constraint
  Adaptive (ECA) method, a novel approach that softly represents the presence of edges,
  allowing for a differentiable representation of prior constraint loss. This soft
  integration can more flexibly adjust to both accurate and erroneous priors, enhancing
  both robustness and adaptability. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach
  effectively leverages prior to improve causal structure accuracy while maintaining
  resilience against prior errors, thus offering significant advancements in the field
  of causal discovery.
