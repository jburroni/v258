title: Mixed-Feature Logistic Regression Robust to Distribution Shifts

openreview: HHgd65xDov
abstract: Logistic regression models are widely used in the social and behavioral
  sciences and in high-stakes domains, due to their simplicity and interpretability
  properties. At the same time, such domains are permeated by distribution shifts,
  where the distribution generating the data changes between training and deployment.
  In this paper, we study a distributionally robust logistic regression problem that
  seeks the model that will perform best against adversarial realizations of the data
  distribution drawn from a suitably constructed Wasserstein ambiguity set.  Our model
  and solution approach differ from prior work in that we can capture settings where
  the likelihood of distribution shifts can vary across features, significantly broadening
  the applicability of our model relative to the state-of-the-art.  We propose a graph-based
  solution approach that can be integrated into off-the-shelf optimization solvers.
  We evaluate the performance of our model and algorithms on numerous publicly available
  datasets. Our solution achieves a 408x speed-up relative to the state-of-the-art.
  Additionally, compared to the state-of-the-art, our model reduces average calibration
  error by up to 36.19% and worst-case calibration error by up to 41.70%, while increasing
  the average area under the ROC curve (AUC) by up to 18.02% and worst-case AUC by
  up to 48.37%.
