title: Double Debiased Machine Learning for Mediation Analysis with Continuous Treatments
software: https://github.com/houssamzenati/double-debiased-machine-learning-mediation-continuous-treatments
openreview: QU6V9ccMRw
abstract: Uncovering causal mediation effects is of significant value to practitioners
  who aim to isolate treatment effects from potential mediator effects. We propose
  a double machine learning (DML) algorithm for mediation analysis that supports continuous
  treatments. To estimate the target mediated response curve, our method employs a
  kernel-based doubly robust moment function for which we prove asymptotic Neyman
  orthogonality. This allows us to obtain an asymptotic normality with nonparametric
  convergence rate while allowing for nonparametric or parametric estimation of the
  nuisance parameters. Subsequently, we derive an optimal bandwidth strategy along
  with a procedure to estimate asymptotic confidence intervals. Finally, to illustrate
  the benefits of our method, we provide a numerical evaluation of our approach on
  a simulation along with an application on medical real-world data to analyze the
  effect of glycemic control on cognitive functions.
