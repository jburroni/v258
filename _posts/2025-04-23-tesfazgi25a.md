abstract: The practical deployment of learning-based autonomous systems would greatly
  benefit from tools that flexibly obtain safety guarantees in the form of certificate
  functions from data. While the geometrical properties of such certificate functions
  are well understood, synthesizing them using machine learning techniques still remains
  a challenge. To mitigate this issue, we propose a diffeomorphic function learning
  framework where prior structural knowledge of the desired output is encoded in the
  geometry of a simple surrogate function, which is subsequently augmented through
  an expressive, topology-preserving state-space transformation. Thereby, we achieve
  an indirect function approximation framework that is guaranteed to remain in the
  desired hypothesis space. To this end, we introduce a novel approach to construct
  diffeomorphic maps based on RBF networks, which facilitate precise, local transformations
  around data. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by learning diffeomorphic Lyapunov
  functions from real-world data and apply our method to different attractor systems.
