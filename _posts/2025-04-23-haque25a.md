title: 'Stochastic Approximation with Unbounded Markovian Noise: A General-Purpose
  Theorem'
openreview: Q3wokjRKUM
abstract: 'Motivated by engineering applications such as resource allocation in networks
  and inventory systems, we consider average-reward Reinforcement Learning with unbounded
  state space and reward function. Recent work Murthy et al. 2024 studied this problem
  in the actor-critic framework and established finite sample bounds assuming access
  to a critic with certain error guarantees. We complement their work by studying
  Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation and establishing
  finite-time bounds with the optimal sample complexity. These results are obtained
  using the following general-purpose theorem for non-linear Stochastic Approximation
  (SA).  Suppose that one constructs a Lyapunov function for a non-linear SA with
  certain drift condition. Then, our theorem establishes finite-time bounds when this
  SA is driven by unbounded Markovian noise under suitable conditions. It serves as
  a black box tool to generalize sample guarantees on SA from i.i.d. or martingale
  difference case to potentially unbounded Markovian noise. The generality and the
  mild assumptions of the setup enables broad applicability of our theorem. We illustrate
  its power by studying two more systems: (i) We improve upon the finite-time bounds
  of Q-learning in Chen et al. 2024 by tightening the error bounds and also allowing
  for a larger class of behavior policies. (ii) We establish the first ever finite-time
  bounds for distributed stochastic optimization of high-dimensional smooth strongly
  convex function using cyclic block coordinate descent.'
