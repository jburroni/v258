title: " Density-Dependent Group Testing "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=GoT8IaDspl "
abstract: ' Group testing is the problem of identifying a small subset of defectives
  from a large set using as few binary tests as possible. In most current literature
  on group testing the binary test outcome is $1$ if the pool contains at least one
  defective, and $0$ otherwise. In this work we initiate the study of a generalized
  model of group testing that accommodates the physical effects of dilution of infected
  samples in large pools. In this model the binary test outcome is $1$ with probability
  $f(\rho)$, where $\rho$ is the density of the defectives in the test, and $f:[0,1]\rightarrow
  [0,1]$ is a given  "test function" that models this dilution process. For a large
  class of test functions our results establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds,
  by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the number of tests necessary
  to recover the set of defective items, and providing computationally efficient algorithms
  with sample complexities that match these lower bounds up to constant or logarithmic
  factors. Furthermore, using tools from real analysis, we extend our results to any
  "sufficiently well-behaved function" $f:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1]$. '
