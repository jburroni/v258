title: 'Unveiling the Role of Randomization in Multiclass Adversarial Classification:
  Insights from Graph Theory'
openreview: XYS4sRkMfE
abstract: Randomization as a mean to improve the adversarial robustness of machine
  learning models has recently attracted significant attention. Unfortunately, much
  of the theoretical analysis so far has focused on binary classification, providing
  only limited insights into the more complex multiclass setting. In this paper, we
  take a step toward closing this gap by drawing inspiration from the field of graph
  theory. Our analysis focuses on discrete data distributions, allowing us to cast
  the adversarial risk minimization problems within the well-established framework
  of set packing problems. By doing so, we are able to identify three structural conditions
  on the support of the data distribution that are necessary for randomization to
  improve robustness. Furthermore, we are able to construct several data distributions
  where (contrarily to binary classification) switching from a deterministic to a
  randomized solution significantly reduces the optimal adversarial risk. These findings
  highlight the crucial role randomization can play in enhancing robustness to adversarial
  attacks in multiclass classification.
