abstract: " Simulation-based inference (SBI) is rapidly becoming the preferred framework
  for estimating parameters of intractable models in science and engineering. A significant
  challenge in this context is the large computational cost of simulating data from
  complex models, and the fact that this cost often depends on parameter values. We
  therefore propose \\emph{cost-aware SBI methods} which can significantly reduce
  the cost of existing sampling-based SBI methods, such as neural SBI and approximate
  Bayesian computation. This is achieved through a combination of rejection and self-normalised
  importance sampling, which significantly reduces the number of expensive simulations
  needed. Our approach is studied extensively on models from epidemiology to telecommunications
  engineering, where we obtain significant reductions in the overall cost of inference. "
