title: 'DDEQs: Distributional Deep Equilibrium Models through Wasserstein Gradient
  Flows'
software: https://github.com/j-geuter/DDEQs
openreview: rFfNuzzXXW
abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are a class of implicit neural networks that
  solve for a fixed point of a neural network in their forward pass. Traditionally,
  DEQs take sequences as inputs, but have since been applied to a variety of data.
  In this work, we present Distributional Deep Equilibrium Models (DDEQs), extending
  DEQs to discrete measure inputs, such as sets or point clouds. We provide a theoretically
  grounded framework for DDEQs. Leveraging Wasserstein gradient flows, we show how
  the forward pass of the DEQ can be adapted to find fixed points of discrete measures
  under permutation-invariance, and derive adequate network architectures for DDEQs.
  In experiments, we show that they can compete with state-of-the-art models in tasks
  such as point cloud classification and point cloud completion, while being significantly
  more parameter-efficient.
