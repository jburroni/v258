title: Prior-Dependent Allocations for Bayesian Fixed-Budget Best-Arm Identification
  in Structured Bandits
software: https://github.com/nguyenicolas/Prior_Dependent_Allocations_BAI.git
openreview: bIfkjlthS0
abstract: We study the problem of Bayesian fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI)
  in structured bandits. We propose an algorithm that uses fixed allocations based
  on the prior information and the structure of the environment. We provide theoretical
  bounds on its performance across diverse models, including the first prior-dependent
  upper bounds for linear and hierarchical BAI. Our key contribution lies in introducing
  novel proof techniques that yield tighter bounds for multi-armed BAI compared to
  existing approaches. Our work provides new insights into Bayesian fixed-budget BAI
  in structured bandits, and extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent and
  robust performance of our method in practice across various settings.
