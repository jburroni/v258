title: Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Linear MDPs via
  Approximation by Discounted-Reward MDPs
openreview: yNeoBG7WOP
abstract: We study the problem of infinite-horizon average-reward reinforcement learning
  with linear Markov decision processes (MDPs). The associated Bellman operator of
  the problem not being a contraction makes the algorithm design challenging. Previous
  approaches either suffer from computational inefficiency or require strong assumptions
  on dynamics, such as ergodicity, for achieving a regret bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$.
  In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
  regret with computational complexity polynomial in the problem parameters, without
  making strong assumptions on dynamics. Our approach approximates the average-reward
  setting by a discounted MDP with a carefully chosen discounting factor, and then
  applies an optimistic value iteration. We propose an algorithmic structure that
  plans for a nonstationary policy through optimistic value iteration and follows
  that policy until a specified information metric in the collected data doubles.
  Additionally, we introduce a value function clipping procedure for limiting the
  span of the value function for sample efficiency.
