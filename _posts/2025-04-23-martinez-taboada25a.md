openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=pW9UW8uDlR "
abstract: " We present a sequential version of the kernelized Stein discrepancy goodness-of-fit
  test, which allows for conducting goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized densities
  that are continuously monitored and adaptively stopped. That is, the sample size
  need not be fixed prior to data collection; the practitioner can choose whether
  to stop the test or continue to gather evidence at any time while controlling the
  false discovery rate. In stark contrast to related literature, we do not impose
  uniform boundedness on the Stein kernel. Instead, we exploit the potential boundedness
  of the Stein kernel at arbitrary point evaluations to define test martingales, that
  give way to the subsequent novel sequential tests. We prove the validity of the
  test, as well as an asymptotic lower bound for the logarithmic growth of the wealth
  process under the alternative.  We further illustrate the empirical performance
  of the test with a variety of distributions, including restricted Boltzmann machines. "
