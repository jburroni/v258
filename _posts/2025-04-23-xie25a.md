abstract: " Bayesian optimization relies on iteratively constructing and optimizing
  an acquisition function. The latter turns out to be a challenging, non-convex optimization
  problem itself. Despite the relative importance of this step, most algorithms employ
  sampling- or gradient-based methods, which do not provably converge to global optima.
  This work investigates mixed-integer programming (MIP) as a paradigm for \\emph{global}
  acquisition function optimization. Specifically, our Piecewise-linear Kernel Mixed
  Integer Quadratic Programming (PK-MIQP) formulation introduces a piecewise-linear
  approximation for Gaussian process kernels and admits a corresponding MIQP representation
  for acquisition functions. The proposed method is applicable to uncertainty-based
  acquisition functions for any stationary or dot-product kernel. We analyze the theoretical
  regret bounds of the proposed approximation, and empirically demonstrate the framework
  on synthetic functions, constrained benchmarks, and a hyperparameter tuning task. "
