title: Bayesian Circular Regression with von Mises Quasi-Processes
software: https://github.com/Yarden231/vMQP
openreview: 4CMgrpXrt1
abstract: The need for regression models to predict circular values arises in many
  scientific fields. In this work we explore a family of expressive and interpretable
  distributions over circle-valued random functions related to Gaussian processes
  targeting two Euclidean dimensions conditioned on the unit circle. The  probability
  model has connections with continuous spin models in statistical physics. Moreover,
  its density is very simple and has maximum-entropy, unlike previous Gaussian process-based
  approaches, which use wrapping or radial marginalization. For posterior inference,
  we introduce a new Stratonovich-like augmentation that lends itself to fast Gibbs
  sampling. We argue that transductive learning in these models favors a Bayesian
  approach to the parameters and apply our sampling scheme to the Double Metropolis-Hastings
  algorithm. We present experiments applying this model to the prediction of (i) wind
  directions and (ii) the percentage of the running gait cycle as a function of joint
  angles.
