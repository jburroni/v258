abstract: " Deep learning models can suffer from severe performance degradation when
  relying on spurious correlations between input features and labels, making the models
  perform well on training data but have poor prediction accuracy for minority groups.
  This problem arises especially when training data are limited or imbalanced. While
  most prior work focuses on learning invariant features (with consistent correlations
  to y), it overlooks the potential harm of spurious correlations between features.
  We hereby propose Elastic Representation (ElRep) to learn features by imposing Nuclear-
  and Frobenius-norm penalties on the representation from the last layer of a neural
  network. Similar to the elastic net, ElRep enjoys the benefits of learning important
  features without losing feature diversity. The proposed method is simple yet effective.
  It can be integrated into many deep learning approaches to mitigate spurious correlations
  and improve group robustness. Moreover, we theoretically show that ElRep has minimum
  negative impacts on in-distribution predictions. This is a remarkable advantage
  over approaches that prioritize minority groups at the cost of overall performance. "
