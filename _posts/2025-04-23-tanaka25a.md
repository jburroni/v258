title: Energy-consistent Neural Operators for Hamiltonian and Dissipative Partial
  Differential Equations

openreview: 8YFRJdr3CS
abstract: The operator learning has received significant attention in recent years,
  with the aim of learning a mapping between function spaces. Prior works have proposed
  deep neural networks (DNNs) for learning such a mapping, enabling the learning of
  solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, these works
  still struggle to learn dynamics that obeys the laws of physics. This paper proposes
  Energy-consistent Neural Operators (ENOs), a general framework for learning solution
  operators of PDEs that follows the energy conservation or dissipation law from observed
  solution trajectories. We introduce a novel penalty function inspired by the energy-based
  theory of physics for training, in which the functional derivative is calculated
  making full use of automatic differentiation, allowing one to bias the outputs of
  the DNN-based solution operators to obey appropriate energetic behavior without
  explicit PDEs. Experiments on multiple systems show that ENO outperforms existing
  DNN models in predicting solutions from data, especially in super-resolution settings.
