abstract: " Fair Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been extensively studied in graph-based
  applications. However, most approaches to fair GNNs assume the full availability
  of demographic information by default, which is often unrealistic due to legal restrictions
  or privacy concerns, leaving a noticeable gap in methods for addressing bias under
  such constraints. To this end, we propose a novel method for fair graph learning
  without demographic information. Our approach leverages a Bayesian variational autoencoder
  to infer missing demographic information and uses disentangled latent variables
  to separately capture demographics-related and label-related information, reducing
  interference when inferring demographic proxies. Additionally, we incorporate a
  fairness regularizer that enables measuring model fairness without demographics
  while optimizing the fairness objective. Extensive experiments on three real-world
  graph datasets demonstrate the proposed methodâ€™s effectiveness in improving both
  fairness and utility. "
