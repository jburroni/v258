title: 'Flexible Copula-Based Mixed Models in Deep Learning: A Scalable Approach to
  Arbitrary Marginals'
software: https://github.com/gsimchoni/copnn
openreview: PQobVi9iPN
abstract: We introduce copula-based neural networks (COPNN), a novel framework that
  extends beyond the limitations of Gaussian marginals for random effects in mixed
  models. COPNN integrates the flexibility of Gaussian copulas in capturing rich dependence
  structures with arbitrary marginal distributions, with the expressive power of deep
  neural networks (DNN), allowing it to model large non-Gaussian data in both regression
  and classification settings, while using batch learning and stochastic gradient
  descent. Unlike traditional linear and non-linear mixed models, which assume Gaussianity
  for random effects, COPNN leverages copulas to decouple the marginal distribution
  from the dependence structure, caused by spatial, temporal and high-cardinality
  categorical features. This is achieved by minimizing a batch negative log-likelihood
  (NLL) loss in the continuous case, and a batch negative pairwise log-likelihood
  in the binary case. We demonstrate COPNN’s effectiveness through extensive experiments
  on both simulated and real datasets. COPNN reduces NLL and MSE in the regression
  setting, and improves predictive accuracy in the classification setting, compared
  to previous state of the art methods which integrate random effects into DNN. Our
  real-world experiments, conducted on datasets from automotive pricing and retail
  traffic forecasting, further validate COPNN’s ability to improve performance over
  traditional methods for dealing with high-cardinality categorical features.
