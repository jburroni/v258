title: The Strong Product Model for Network Inference without Independence Assumptions
software: https://github.com/BaileyAndrew/Strong-Product-Model/tree/main
openreview: BhmLkJiahO
abstract: Multi-axis graphical modelling techniques allow us to perform network inference
  without making independence assumptions.  This is done by replacing the independence
  assumption with a weaker assumption about the interaction between the axes; there
  are several choices for which assumption to use.  In single-cell RNA sequencing
  data, genes may interact differently depending on whether they are expressed in
  the same cell, or in different cells.  Unfortunately, current methods are not able
  to make this distinction.  In this paper, we address this problem by introducing
  the strong product model for Gaussian graphical modelling.
