title: " A Tight Regret Analysis of Non-Parametric Repeated Contextual Brokerage "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=U2RgUAySB6 "
abstract: " We study a contextual version of the repeated brokerage problem.  In each
  interaction, two traders with private valuations for an item seek to buy or sell
  based on the learner’s—a broker—proposed price, which is informed by some contextual
  information. The broker’s goal is to maximize the traders’ net utility—also known
  as the gain from trade—by minimizing regret compared to an oracle with perfect knowledge
  of traders’ valuation distributions. We assume that traders’ valuations are zero-mean
  perturbations of the unknown item’s current market value—which can change arbitrarily
  from one interaction to the next—and that similar contexts will correspond to similar
  market prices. We analyze two feedback settings: full-feedback, where after each
  interaction the traders’ valuations are revealed to the broker, and limited-feedback,
  where only transaction attempts are revealed. For both feedback types, we propose
  algorithms achieving tight regret bounds. We further strengthen our performance
  guarantees by providing a tight $1/2$-approximation result showing that the oracle
  that knows the traders’ valuation distributions achieves at least $1/2$ of the gain
  from trade of the omniscient oracle that knows in advance the actual realized traders’
  valuations. "
