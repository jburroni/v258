  Loss Perspective and Gap-Dependent Regret Analysis "

abstract: " This paper revisits the online learning approach to inverse linear optimization
  studied by B{ä}rmann et al. (2017), where the goal is to infer an unknown linear
  objective function of an agent from sequential observations of the agent’s input-output
  pairs. First, we provide a simple understanding of the online learning approach
  through its connection to online convex optimization of \\emph{Fenchel–Young losses}.
  As a byproduct, we present an offline guarantee on the \\emph{suboptimality loss},
  which measures how well predicted objective vectors explain the agent’s choices,
  without assuming the optimality of the agent’s choices. Second, assuming that there
  is a gap between optimal and suboptimal objective values in the agent’s decision
  problems, we obtain an upper bound independent of the time horizon $T$ on the sum
  of suboptimality and \\emph{estimate losses}, where the latter measures the quality
  of solutions recommended by predicted objective vectors. Interestingly, our gap-dependent
  analysis achieves a faster rate than the standard $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound by
  exploiting structures specific to inverse linear optimization, even though neither
  the loss functions nor their domains possess desirable properties, such as strong
  convexity. "
