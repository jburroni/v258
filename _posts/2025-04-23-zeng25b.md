title: On the Power of Adaptive Weighted Aggregation in Heterogeneous Federated Learning
  and Beyond
software: https://github.com/dunzeng/FedAWARE
openreview: 9dUT2AMjEu
abstract: Federated averaging (FedAvg) is the most fundamental algorithm in Federated
  learning (FL). Previous theoretical results assert that FedAvg convergence and generalization
  degenerate under heterogeneous clients.  However, recent empirical results show
  that FedAvg can perform well in many real-world heterogeneous tasks. These results
  reveal an inconsistency between FL theory and practice that is not fully explained.  In
  this paper, we show that common heterogeneity measures contribute to this inconsistency
  based on rigorous convergence analysis. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure
  \textit{client consensus dynamics} and prove that \textit{FedAvg can effectively
  handle client heterogeneity when an appropriate aggregation strategy is used}.  Building
  on this theoretical insight, we present a simple and effective FedAvg variant termed
  FedAWARE.  Extensive experiments on three datasets and two modern neural network
  architectures demonstrate that FedAWARE ensures faster convergence and better generalization
  in heterogeneous client settings. Moreover, our results show that FedAWARE can significantly
  enhance the generalization performance of advanced FL algorithms when used as a
  plug-in module.
