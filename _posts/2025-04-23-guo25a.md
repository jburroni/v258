title: Cross-Modal Imputation and Uncertainty Estimation for Spatial Transcriptomics
software: https://github.com/woweizhi/Cross-modal-Imputation-Uncertainty-Estimation-ST
openreview: 7QZ65OECUt
abstract: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies can capture gene
  expression at the cellular level along with spatial information, but are limited
  in the number of genes that can be profiled. In contrast, single-cell RNA sequencing
  (SC) provides more comprehensive gene expression profiles but lacks spatial context.
  To bridge these gaps, existing methods typically focus on single-modality prediction
  tasks, leveraging complementary information from the other modality.  Here, we propose
  an attention-based cross-modal framework that simultaneously imputes gene expression
  for ST and recovers spatial locations for SC, while also providing uncertainty estimates
  for the expression of the imputed genes. Our approach was evaluated on three real-world
  datasets, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in spatial
  gene profile imputation.  Moreover, our framework enhances latent embedding integration
  between the two modalities, resulting in more accurate spatial position estimates.
