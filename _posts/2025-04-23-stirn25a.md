abstract: " Widely used deep latent variable models (DLVMs), in particular Variational
  Autoencoders (VAEs), employ overly simplistic priors on the latent space. To achieve
  strong clustering performance, existing methods that replace the standard normal
  prior with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) require defining the number of clusters
  to be close to the number of expected ground truth classes a-priori and are susceptible
  to poor initializations. We leverage VampPrior concepts (Tomczak and Welling, 2018)
  to fit a Bayesian GMM prior, resulting in the VampPrior Mixture Model (VMM), a novel
  prior for DLVMs. In a VAE, the VMM attains highly competitive clustering performance
  on benchmark datasets. Integrating the VMM into scVI (Lopez et al., 2018), a popular
  scRNA-seq integration method, significantly improves its performance and automatically
  arranges cells into clusters with similar biological characteristics. "
