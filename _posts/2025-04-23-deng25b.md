title: " Near-Optimal Sample Complexity for Iterated CVaR Reinforcement Learning with
  a Generative Model "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=VmqRTQLhoD "
abstract: " In this work, we study the sample complexity problem of risk-sensitive
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a generative model, where we aim to maximize the
  Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) with risk tolerance level $\\tau$ at each step,
  named Iterated CVaR.  We develop nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the sample
  complexity for this problem. Specifically, we first prove that a value iteration-based
  algorithm, ICVaR-VI, achieves an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy with at most $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\frac{SA}{(1-\\gamma)^4\\tau^2\\epsilon^2}\\right)$
  samples, where $\\gamma$ is the discount factor, and $S, A$ are the sizes of the
  state and action spaces. Furthermore,  if $\\tau \\geq \\gamma$, then the sample
  complexity can be further improved to $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{SA}{(1-\\gamma)^3\\epsilon^2}
  \\right)$.  We further show a minimax lower bound of ${\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}}\\left(\\frac{(1-\\gamma
  \\tau)SA}{(1-\\gamma)^4\\tau\\epsilon^2}\\right)$.  For a constant risk level $0<\\tau\\leq
  1$, our upper and lower bounds match with each other, demonstrating the tightness
  and optimality of our analyses. We also investigate a limiting case with a small
  risk level $\\tau$, called Worst-Path RL, where the objective is to maximize the
  minimum possible cumulative reward. We develop matching upper and lower bounds of
  $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\frac{SA}{p_{\\min}}\\right)$, where $p_{\\min}$ denotes
  the minimum non-zero reaching probability of the transition kernel. "
