title: 'UNHaP: Unmixing Noise from Hawkes Processes'
software: https://github.com/mind-inria/FaDIn
openreview: 9QqSTI4ZD5
abstract: Physiological signal analysis often involves identifying events crucial
  to understanding biological dynamics.  Many methods have been proposed to detect
  them, from handcrafted and supervised approaches to unsupervised techniques. All
  these methods tend to produce spurious events, mainly as they detect each event
  independently. This work introduces UNHaP (Unmix Noise from Hawkes Processes), a
  novel approach addressing the joint learning of temporal structures in events and
  the removal of spurious detections. By treating the event detection output as a
  mixture of structured Hawkes and unstructured Poisson events, UNHaP efficiently
  unmixes these processes and estimates their parameters. This approach significantly
  enhances event distribution characterization while minimizing false detection rates
  on simulated and real data.
