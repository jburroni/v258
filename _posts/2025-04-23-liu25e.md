  Inventory Control

abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be well-performed and versatile
  in inventory control (IC). However, further improvement of RL algorithms in the
  IC domain is impeded by two limitations of online experience. First, online experience
  is expensive to acquire in real-world applications. With the low sample efficiency
  nature of RL algorithms, it would take extensive time to collect enough data and
  train the RL policy to convergence. Second, online experience may not reflect the
  true demand due to the lost-sales phenomenon typical in IC, which makes the learning
  process more challenging. To address the above challenges, we propose a training
  framework that combines reinforcement learning with feedback graph (RLFG) and intrinsically
  motivated exploration (IME) to boost sample efficiency. In particular, we first
  leverage the MDP structure inherent in lost-sales IC problems and design the feedback
  graph (FG) tailored to lost-sales IC problems to generate abundant side experiences
  aiding in RL updates. Then we conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis of how the
  designed FG reduces the sample complexity of RL methods. Guided by these insights,
  we design an intrinsic reward to direct the RL agent to explore to the state-action
  space with more side experiences, further exploiting FGâ€™s capability. Experimental
  results on single-item, multi-item, and multi-echelon environments demonstrate that
  our method greatly improves the sample efficiency of applying RL in IC.  Our code
