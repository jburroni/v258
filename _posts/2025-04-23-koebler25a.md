abstract: " We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual
  distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading
  to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose Incremental
  Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free method that
  estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using optimal transport.
  In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the performance prediction and introduces
  an active labeling procedure to restore a reliable estimate under a limited labeling
  budget. Our experiments show that IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation
  baselines in various gradual shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness
  guides label acquisition more effectively compared to other strategies. "
