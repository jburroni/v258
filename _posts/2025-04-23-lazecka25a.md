abstract: " Integrating various data modalities brings valuable insights into underlying
  phenomena. Multimodal factor analysis (FA) uncovers shared axes of variation underlying
  different simple data modalities, where each sample is  represented by a vector
  of features. However, FA is not suited for structured data modalities, such as text
  or single cell sequencing data, where multiple data points are measured per each
  sample and exhibit a clustering structure. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
  FACTM, a novel, multi-view and multi-structure Bayesian model that combines FA with
  correlated topic modeling and is optimized using variational inference. Additionally,
  we introduce a method for rotating latent factors to enhance interpretability with
  respect to binary features. On text and video benchmarks as well as real-world music
  and COVID-19 datasets, we demonstrate that FACTM outperforms other methods in identifying
  clusters in structured data, and integrating them with simple modalities via the
  inference of shared, interpretable factors. "
