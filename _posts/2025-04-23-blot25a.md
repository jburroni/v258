abstract: " Science and technology have a growing need for effective mechanisms that
  ensure reliable, controlled performance from black-box machine learning algorithms.
  These performance guarantees should ideally hold conditionally on the input—that
  is the performance guarantees should hold, at least approximately, no matter what
  the input. However, beyond stylized discrete groupings such as ethnicity and gender,
  the right notion of conditioning can be difficult to define. For example, in problems
  such as image segmentation, we want the uncertainty to reflect the intrinsic difficulty
  of the test sample, but this may be difficult to capture via a conditioning event.
  Building on the recent work of Gibbs et al. [2023], we propose a methodology for
  achieving approximate conditional control of statistical risks—the expected value
  of loss functions—by adapting to the difficulty of test samples. Our framework goes
  beyond traditional conditional risk  control based on user-provided conditioning
  events to the algorithmic, data-driven determination of appropriate function classes
  for conditioning. We apply this framework to various regression and segmentation
  tasks, enabling finer-grained control over model performance and demonstrating that
  by continuously monitoring and adjusting these parameters, we can achieve superior
  precision compared to conventional risk-control methods. "
