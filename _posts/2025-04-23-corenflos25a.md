abstract: " Given an unconditional diffusion model targeting a joint model $\\pi(x,
  y)$, using it to perform conditional simulation $\\pi(x \\mid y)$ is still largely
  an open question and is typically achieved by learning conditional drifts to the
  denoising SDE after the fact. In this work, we express \\emph{exact} conditional
  simulation within the \\emph{approximate} diffusion model as an inference problem
  on an augmented space corresponding to a partial SDE bridge. This perspective allows
  us to implement efficient and principled particle Gibbs and pseudo-marginal samplers
  marginally targeting the conditional distribution $\\pi(x \\mid y)$. Contrary to
  existing methodology, our methods do not introduce any additional approximation
  to the unconditional diffusion model aside from the Monte Carlo error. We showcase
  the benefits and drawbacks of our approach on a series of synthetic and real data
  examples. "
