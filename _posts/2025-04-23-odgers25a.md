abstract: " This work develops a Bayesian non-parametric approach to signal separation
  where the signals may vary according to latent variables.  Our key contribution
  is to augment Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) for the case where
  each data point comprises the weighted sum of a known number of pure component signals,
  observed across several input locations. Our framework allows arbitrary non-linear
  variations in the signals while being able to incorporate useful priors for the
  linear weights, such as summing-to-one. Our contributions are particularly relevant
  to spectroscopy, where changing conditions may cause the underlying pure component
  signals to vary from sample to sample. To demonstrate the applicability to both
  spectroscopy and other domains, we consider several applications: a near-infrared
  spectroscopy dataset with varying temperatures, a simulated dataset for identifying
  flow configuration through a pipe, and a dataset for determining the type of rock
  from its reflectance. "
