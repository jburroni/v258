abstract: " This paper presents Adaptive Parameter Optimisation (APO), a novel framework
  for optimising shared models across multiple clinical tasks, addressing the challenges
  of balancing strict parameter sharing—often leading to task conflicts—and soft parameter
  sharing, which may limit effective cross-task information exchange. The proposed
  APO framework leverages insights from the lazy behaviour observed in over-parameterised
  neural networks, where only a small subset of parameters undergo any substantial
  updates during training. APO dynamically identifies and updates task-specific parameters
  while treating parameters associated with other tasks as protected, limiting their
  modification to prevent interference. The remaining unassigned parameters remain
  unchanged, embodying the lazy training phenomenon. This dynamic management of task-specific,
  protected, and unclaimed parameters across tasks enables effective information sharing,
  preserves task-specific adaptability, and mitigates gradient conflicts without enforcing
  a uniform representation. Experimental results across diverse healthcare datasets
  demonstrate that APO surpasses traditional information-sharing approaches, such
  as multi-task learning and model-agnostic meta-learning, in improving task performance. "
