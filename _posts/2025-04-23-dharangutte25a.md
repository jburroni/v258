title: Differentially Private Range Queries with Correlated Input Perturbation
software: https://github.com/prathameshtd/DPRQ-correlated-noise
openreview: 7Xc2asGD0p
abstract: This work proposes a class of differentially private mechanisms for linear
  queries, in particular range queries, that leverages correlated input perturbation
  to simultaneously achieve unbiasedness, consistency, statistical transparency, and
  control over utility requirements in terms of accuracy targets expressed either
  in certain query margins or as implied by the hierarchical database structure. The
  proposed Cascade Sampling algorithm instantiates the mechanism exactly and efficiently.
  Our theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrates that we achieve near-optimal
  utility, effectively compete with other methods, and retain all the favorable statistical
  properties discussed earlier.
