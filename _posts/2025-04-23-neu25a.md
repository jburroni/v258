title: " Offline RL via Feature-Occupancy Gradient Ascent "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hbwh76xE8S "
abstract: " We study offline Reinforcement Learning in large infinite-horizon discounted
  Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the reward and transition models are linearly
  realizable under a known feature map. Starting from the classic linear-program formulation
  of the optimal control problem in MDPs, we develop a new algorithm that performs
  a form of gradient ascent in the space of feature occupancies, defined as the expected
  feature vectors that can potentially be generated by executing policies in the environment.
  We show that the resulting simple algorithm satisfies strong computational and sample
  complexity guarantees, achieved under the least restrictive data coverage assumptions
  known in the literature. In particular, we show that the sample complexity of our
  method scales optimally with the desired accuracy level and depends on a weak notion
  of coverage that only requires the empirical feature covariance matrix to cover
  a single direction in the feature space (as opposed to covering a full subspace).
  Additionally, our method can be implemented efficiently without requiring any computational
  oracles, and requires no prior knowledge of the coverage ratio (or even an upper
  bound on it), which altogether make it the strongest known algorithm for this setting
  to date. "
