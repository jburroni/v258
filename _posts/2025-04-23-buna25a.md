title: " Robust Gradient Descent for Phase Retrieval "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=Wi1IlPePEP "
abstract: " Recent progress in robust statistical learning has mainly tackled convex
  problems, like mean estimation or linear regression, with non-convex challenges
  receiving less attention. Phase retrieval exemplifies such a non-convex problem,
  requiring the recovery of a signal from only the magnitudes of its linear measurements,
  without phase (sign) information. While several non-convex methods, especially those
  involving the Wirtinger Flow algorithm, have been proposed for noiseless or mild
  noise settings, developing solutions for heavy-tailed noise and adversarial corruption
  remains an open challenge. In this paper, we investigate an approach that leverages
  robust gradient descent techniques to improve the Wirtinger Flow algorithmâ€™s ability
  to simultaneously cope with fourth moment bounded noise and adversarial contamination
  in both the inputs (covariates) and outputs (responses). We address two scenarios:
  known zero-mean noise and completely unknown noise. For the latter, we propose a
  preprocessing step that alters the problem into a new format that does not fit traditional
  phase retrieval approaches but can still be resolved with a tailored version of
  the algorithm for the zero-mean noise context. "
