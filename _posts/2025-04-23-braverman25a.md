title: Fully Dynamic Adversarially Robust Correlation Clustering in Polylogarithmic
  Update Time
openreview: Zqoq7L7o2E
abstract: We study the dynamic correlation clustering problem with \emph{adaptive}
  edge label flips. In correlation clustering, we are given a $n$-vertex complete
  graph whose edges are labeled either $(+)$ or $(-)$, and the goal is to minimize
  the total number of $(+)$ edges between clusters and the number of $(-)$ edges within
  clusters. We consider the dynamic setting with adversarial robustness, in which
  the \emph{adaptive} adversary can flip the label of an edge based on the current
  output of the algorithm. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that always maintains
  an $O(1)$-approximation to the optimal correlation clustering with $O(\log^{2}{n})$
  amortized update time. Prior to our work, no algorithm with $O(1)$-approximation
  and $\text{polylog}{(n)}$ update time for the adversarially robust setting was known.
  We further validate our theoretical results with experiments on synthetic and real-world
  datasets with competitive empirical performances. Our main technical ingredient
  is an algorithm that maintains \emph{sparse-dense decomposition} with $\text{polylog}{(n)}$
  update time, which could be of independent interest.
