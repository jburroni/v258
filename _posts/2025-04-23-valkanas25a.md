abstract: " Online deep learning tackles the challenge of learning from data streams
  by balancing two competing goals: fast learning and deep learning. However, existing
  research primarily emphasizes deep learning solutions, which are more adept at handling
  the ”deep” aspect than the ”fast” aspect of online learning. In this work, we introduce
  an alternative paradigm through a hybrid multilearner approach. We begin by developing
  a fast online logistic regression learner, which operates without relying on backpropagation.
  It leverages closed-form recursive updates of model parameters, efficiently addressing
  the fast learning component of the online learning challenge. This approach is further
  integrated with a cascaded multilearner design, where shallow and deep learners
  are co-trained in a cooperative, synergistic manner to solve the online learning
  problem. We demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
  on standard online learning datasets. We make our code available: \\url{https://github.com/AntonValk/MODL} "
