abstract: " Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell
  RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific
  discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges.
  Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation
  along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths.
  To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA),
  a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling.
  GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries
  discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the
  data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold
  and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful
  geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample
  points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between
  populations across the learned manifold. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated
  and real-world datasets, including a 30% improvement over SOTA in single-cell population-level
  trajectory inference. "
