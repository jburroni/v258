abstract: " Computer vision models can be explained by attributing the output decision
  to the input pixels. While effective methods for explaining convolutional neural
  networks have been proposed, these methods often produce low-quality attributions
  when applied to vision transformers (ViTs). State-of-the-art methods for explaining
  ViTs capture the flow of patch information using transition matrices. However, we
  observe that transition matrices alone are not sufficiently expressive to accurately
  explain ViT models. In this paper, we define a theoretical approach to creating
  explanations for ViTs called InFlow. The framework models the  patch-to-patch information
  flow using a combination of transition matrices and patch embeddings. Moreover,
  we define an algebra for updating the transition matrices of series connected components,
  diverging paths, and converging paths in the ViT model. This algebra allows the
  InFlow framework to produce high quality attributions which explain ViT decision
  making. In experimental evaluation on ImageNet, with three models, InFlow outperforms
  six ViT attribution methods in the standard insertion, deletion, SIC and AIC metrics
  by up to 18%. Qualitative results demonstrate InFlow produces more relevant and
  sharper explanations. Code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/chasewalker26/InFlow-ViT-Explanation.} "
