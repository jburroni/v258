abstract: " Prompt learning is a popular fine-tuning method for vision-language models
  due to its efficiency. It requires a small number of additional learnable parameters
  while significantly enhancing performance on target tasks. However, most existing
  methods suffer from overfitting to fine-tuning data, yielding poor generalizability.
  To address this, we propose a new training objective function based on a Bayesian
  learning principle to balance adaptability and generalizability. We derive a prior
  over the logits, where the mean function is parameterized by the pre-trained model,
  while the posterior corresponds to the fine-tuned model. This objective establishes
  a balance by allowing the fine-tuned model to adapt to downstream tasks while remaining
  close to the pre-trained model. To avoid the overfitting issues of the standard
  softmax function, we adopt the one-vs-each softmax approximation along with its
  PÃ³lya-Gamma augmentation (OVE-PG). We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets
  and demonstrate that using the Bayesian principle for prompt learning is indeed
  a sensible choice. Code is available at the \\url{https://github.com/ParkLabML/Bayesian_Principles_Improve_Prompt_Learning_In_Vision_Language_Models.} "
