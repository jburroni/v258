abstract: " Often in prediction tasks, the predictive model itself can influence the
  distribution of the target variable, a phenomenon termed \\emph{performative prediction}.
  Generally, this influence stems from strategic actions taken by stakeholders with
  a vested interest in predictive models. A key challenge that hinders the widespread
  adaptation of performative prediction in machine learning is that practitioners
  are generally unaware of the social impacts of their predictions. To address this
  gap, we propose a methodology for learning the distribution map that encapsulates
  the long-term impacts of predictive models on the population. Specifically, we model
  agentsâ€™ responses as a cost-adjusted utility maximization problem and propose estimates
  for said cost. Our approach leverages optimal transport to align pre-model exposure
  (\\emph{ex ante}) and post-model exposure (\\emph{ex post}) distributions. We provide
  a rate of convergence for this proposed estimate and assess its quality through
  empirical demonstrations on a credit scoring dataset. "
