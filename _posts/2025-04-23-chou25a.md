abstract: Over the past years, there has been significant interest in understanding
  the implicit bias of gradient descent optimization and its connection to the generalization
  properties of overparametrized neural networks. Several works observed that when
  training linear diagonal networks on the square loss for regression tasks (which
  corresponds to overparametrized linear regression) gradient descent converges to
  special solutions, e.g., non-negative ones. We connect this observation to Riemannian
  optimization and view overparametrized GD with identical initialization as a Riemannian
  GD. We use this fact for solving non-negative least squares (NNLS), an important
  problem behind many techniques, e.g., non-negative matrix factorization. We show
  that gradient flow on the reparametrized objective converges globally to NNLS solutions,
  providing convergence rates also for its discretized counterpart. Unlike previous
  methods, we do not rely on the calculation of exponential maps or geodesics. We
  further show accelerated convergence using a second-order ODE, lending itself to
  accelerated descent methods. Finally, we establish the stability against negative
  perturbations and discuss generalization to other constrained optimization problems.
