abstract: " Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential
  in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling
  complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications
  remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial
  attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for
  LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box
  optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that
  significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM
  architectures. Our experiments, which include models like LLMTime with GPT-3.5,
  GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, TimeGPT, and TimeLLM show that adversarial attacks lead
  to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the
  broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore
  the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the
  need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical
  applications. The code repository can be found at \\url{https://github.com/JohnsonJiang1996/AdvAttack_LLM4TS.} "
