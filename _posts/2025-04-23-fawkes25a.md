title: Is Merging Worth It? Securely Evaluating the Information Gain for Causal Dataset
  Acquisition

openreview: 2831ZzaTL2
abstract: 'Merging datasets across institutions is a lengthy and costly procedure,
  especially when it involves private information.  Data hosts may therefore want
  to prospectively gauge which datasets are most beneficial to merge with, without
  revealing sensitive information. For causal estimation this is particularly challenging
  as the value of a merge depends not only on reduction in epistemic uncertainty but
  also on improvement in overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the first
  \emph{cryptographically secure} information-theoretic approach for quantifying the
  value of a merge in the context of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation. We
  do this by evaluating the \emph{Expected Information Gain} (EIG) using multi-party
  computation to ensure that no raw data is revealed. We further demonstrate that
  our approach can be combined with differential privacy (DP) to meet arbitrary privacy
  requirements whilst preserving more accurate computation compared to DP alone. To
  the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first privacy-preserving method
  for dataset acquisition tailored to causal estimation.Code is publicly available:
