abstract: " Topological methods for comparing weighted graphs are valuable in various
  learning tasks but often suffer from computational inefficiency on large datasets.
  We introduce RTD-Lite, a scalable algorithm that efficiently compares topological
  features, specifically connectivity or cluster structures at arbitrary scales, of
  two weighted graphs with one-to-one correspondence between vertices. By leveraging
  minimal spanning trees in auxiliary graphs, RTD-Lite captures topological discrepancies
  with $O(n^2)$ time and memory complexity. This efficiency enables its application
  in tasks like dimensionality reduction and neural network training. Experiments
  on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that RTD-Lite effectively identifies
  topological differences while significantly reducing computation time compared to
  existing methods. Moreover, integrating RTD-Lite into neural network training as
  a loss function component enhances the preservation of topological structures in
  learned representations. Our code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/ArGintum/RTD-Lite.} "
