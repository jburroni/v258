title: A Family of Distributions of Random Subsets for Controlling Positive and Negative
  Dependence

openreview: EL1l4TCUqP
abstract: Positive and negative dependence are fundamental concepts that characterize
  the attractive and repulsive behavior of random subsets. Although some probabilistic
  models are known to exhibit positive or negative dependence, it is challenging to
  seamlessly bridge them with a practicable probabilistic model. In this study, we
  introduce a new family of distributions, named the discrete kernel point process
  (DKPP), which includes determinantal point processes and parts of Boltzmann machines.
  We also develop some computational methods for probabilistic operations and inference
  with DKPPs, such as calculating marginal and conditional probabilities and learning
  the parameters. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the controllability of positive
  and negative dependence and the effectiveness of the computational methods for DKPPs.
