abstract: We present a class of diffusion-based algorithms to draw samples from high-dimensional
  probability distributions given their unnormalized densities. Ideally, our methods
  can transport samples from a Gaussian distribution to a specified target distribution
  in finite time. Our approach relies on the stochastic interpolants framework to
  define a time-indexed collection of probability densities that bridge a Gaussian
  distribution to the target distribution. Subsequently, we derive a diffusion process
  that obeys the aforementioned probability density at each time instant. Obtaining
  such a diffusion process involves solving certain Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs.
  We solve these PDEs using the theory of forward-backward stochastic differential
  equations (FBSDE) together with machine learning-based methods. Through numerical
  experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively draw samples from
  distributions that conventional methods struggle to handle.
