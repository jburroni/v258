  Testing (DeepBET)

abstract: This paper focuses on testing conditional independence between two random
  variables ($X$ and $Y$) given a set of high-dimensional confounding variables ($Z$).
  The high dimensionality of these confounding variables presents a challenge, often
  resulting in inflated type-I errors or insufficient power in many existing tests.
  To address this issue, we leverage the power of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to handle
  complex, high-dimensional data while mitigating the curse of dimensionality. We
  propose a novel test procedure, DeepBET. First, a DNN is used on part of the data
  to estimate the conditional means of $X$ and $Y$ given $Z$. Then, binary expansion
  testing (BET) are applied to the predicted errors from the remaining data. Additionally,
  we implement a multiple-split procedure to further enhance the power of the test.
  DeepBET is computationally efficient and robust to the tuning parameters in DNNs.
  Interestingly, the DeepBET statistic converges at a root-$n$ rate despite the nonparametric
  and high-dimensional nature of the confounding effects. Our numerical results demonstrate
  that the proposed method controls type-I error under various scenarios and enhances
  both power and interpretability for conditional dependence when present, making
  it a robust  alternative for testing conditional independence in high-dimensional
  settings. When applied to dry eye disease data, DeepBET reveals meaningful nonlinear
  relationships between the epithelial thickness and the tear production in the central
  region of eyes, given other regions.
