abstract: 'This paper introduces a general framework for risk-sensitive bandits that
  integrates the notions of risk-sensitive objectives by adopting a rich class of
  {\em distortion riskmetrics}. The introduced framework subsumes the various existing
  risk-sensitive models. An important and hitherto unknown observation is that for
  a wide range of riskmetrics, the optimal bandit policy involves selecting a \emph{mixture}
  of arms. This is in sharp contrast to the convention in the multi-arm bandit algorithms
  that there is generally a \emph{solitary} arm that maximizes the utility, whether
  purely reward-centric or risk-sensitive. This creates a major departure from the
  principles for designing bandit algorithms since there are uncountable mixture possibilities.
  The contributions of the paper are as follows: (i) it formalizes a general framework
  for risk-sensitive bandits, (ii) identifies standard risk-sensitive bandit models
  for which solitary arm selections is not optimal, (iii) and designs regret-efficient
  algorithms whose sampling strategies can accurately track optimal arm mixtures (when
  mixture is optimal) or the solitary arms (when solitary is optimal). The algorithms
  are shown to achieve a regret that scales according to $O((\log T/T )^{\nu})$,  where
  $T$ is the horizon, and $\nu>0$ is a riskmetric-specific constant.'
