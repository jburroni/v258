title: 'Adapting to Online Distribution Shifts in Deep Learning: A Black-Box Approach'
openreview: CE6E3ZgAUd
abstract: We study the well-motivated problem of online distribution shift in which
  the data arrive in batches and the distribution of each batch can change arbitrarily
  over time. Since the shifts can be large or small, abrupt or gradual, the length
  of the relevant historical data to learn from may vary over time, which poses a
  major challenge in designing algorithms that can automatically adapt to the best
  "attention span” while remaining computationally efficient. We propose a meta-algorithm
  that takes any network architecture and any Online Learner (OL) algorithm as input
  and produces a new algorithm which provably enhances the performance of the given
  OL under non-stationarity. Our algorithm is efficient (it requires maintaining only  $O(\log
  T)$ OL instances) and adaptive (it automatically chooses OL instances with the ideal
  "attention” length at every timestamp). Experiments on various real-world datasets
  across text and image modalities show that our method consistently improves the
  accuracy of user specified OL algorithms for classification tasks. Key novel algorithmic
  ingredients include a multi-resolution instance design inspired by wavelet theory
  and a cross-validation-through-time technique. Both could be of independent interest.
