title: 'M-HOF-Opt: Multi-Objective Hierarchical Output Feedback Optimization via Multiplier
  Induced Loss Landscape Scheduling'
software: https://github.com/marrlab/DomainLab/tree/mhof
openreview: 8LRZ62HWp3
abstract: A probabilistic graphical model is proposed, modeling the joint model parameter
  and multiplier evolution, with a hypervolume based likelihood, promoting multi-objective
  descent in structural risk minimization.  We address multi-objective model parameter
  optimization via a surrogate single objective penalty loss with time-varying multipliers,
  equivalent to online scheduling of loss landscape.  The multi-objective descent
  goal is dispatched hierarchically into a series of constraint optimization sub-problems
  with shrinking bounds according to Pareto dominance. The bound serves as setpoint
  for the low-level multiplier controller to schedule loss landscapes via output feedback
  of each loss term. Our method forms closed loop of model parameter dynamic, circumvents
  excessive memory requirements and extra computational burden of existing multi-objective
  deep learning methods, and is robust against controller hyperparameter variation,
  demonstrated on domain generalization tasks.
