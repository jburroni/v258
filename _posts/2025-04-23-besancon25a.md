abstract: " We propose the pivoting meta algorithm (PM) to enhance optimization algorithms
  that generate iterates as convex combinations of vertices of a feasible region $C\\subseteq
  \\mathbb{R}^n$, including Frank-Wolfe (FW) variants. PM guarantees that the active
  set (the set of vertices in the convex combination) of the modified algorithm remains
  as small as $dim(C)+1$ as stipulated by Carath{é}odory’s theorem. PM achieves this
  by reformulating the active set expansion task into an equivalent linear program,
  which can be efficiently solved using a single pivot step akin to the primal simplex
  algorithm; the convergence rate of the original algorithms are maintained. Furthermore,
  we establish the connection between PM and active set identification, in particular
  showing under mild assumptions that PM applied to the away-step Frank-Wolfe algorithm
  or the blended pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm bounds the active set size by the
  dimension of the optimal face plus $1$. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate
  practicality and efficacy on active set size reduction. "
