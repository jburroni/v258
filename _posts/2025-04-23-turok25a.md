title: Sampling From Multiscale Densities With Delayed Rejection Generalized Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo
software: https://github.com/gil2rok/drghmc
openreview: h6BirxTrpA
abstract: 'Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is the mainstay of applied Bayesian inference
  for differentiable models. However, HMC still struggles to sample from hierarchical
  models that induce densities with multiscale geometry: a large step size is needed
  to efficiently explore low curvature regions while a small step size is needed to
  accurately explore high curvature regions. We introduce the delayed rejection generalized
  HMC (DR-G-HMC) sampler that overcomes this challenge by employing dynamic step size
  selection, inspired by differential equation solvers. In generalized HMC, each iteration
  does a single leapfrog step. DR-G-HMC sequentially makes proposals with geometrically
  decreasing step sizes upon rejection of earlier proposals. This simulates Hamiltonian
  dynamics that can adjust its step size along a (stochastic) Hamiltonian trajectory
  to deal with regions of high curvature. DR-G-HMC makes generalized HMC competitive
  by decreasing the number of rejections which otherwise cause inefficient backtracking
  and prevents directed movement. We present experiments to demonstrate that DR-G-HMC
  (1) correctly samples from multiscale densities, (2) makes generalized HMC methods
  competitive with the state of the art No-U-Turn sampler, and (3) is robust to tuning
  parameters.'
