title: " Quantifying the Optimization and Generalization Advantages of Graph Neural
  Networks Over Multilayer Perceptrons "

abstract: " Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
  in learning from graph-structured data, often outperforming traditional Multilayer
  Perceptrons (MLPs) in numerous graph-based tasks. Although existing works have demonstrated
  the benefits of graph convolution through Laplacian smoothing, expressivity or separability,
  there remains a lack of quantitative analysis comparing GNNs and MLPs from an optimization
  and generalization perspective. This study aims to address this gap by examining
  the role of graph convolution through feature learning theory. Using a signal-noise
  data model, we conduct a comparative analysis of the optimization and generalization
  between two-layer graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and their MLP counterparts.
  Our approach tracks the trajectory of signal learning and noise memorization in
  GNNs, characterizing their post-training generalization. We reveal that GNNs significantly
  prioritize signal learning, thus enhancing the regime of {low test error} over MLPs
  by $D^{q-2}$ times, where $D$ denotes a nodeâ€™s expected degree and $q$ is the power
  of ReLU activation function with $q>2$. This finding highlights a substantial and
  quantitative discrepancy between GNNs and MLPs in terms of optimization and generalization,
  a conclusion further supported by our empirical simulations on both synthetic and
  real-world datasets. "
