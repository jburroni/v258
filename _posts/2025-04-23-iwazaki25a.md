title: " Near-Optimal Algorithm for Non-Stationary Kernelized Bandits "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=1y9UG4YOnm "
abstract: " This paper studies a non-stationary kernelized bandit (KB) problem, also
  called time-varying Bayesian optimization, where one seeks to minimize the regret
  under an unknown reward function that varies over time. In particular, we focus
  on a near-optimal algorithm whose regret upper bound matches the regret lower bound.
  For this goal, we show the first algorithm-independent regret lower bound for non-stationary
  KB with squared exponential and Mat√©rn kernels, which reveals that an existing optimization-based
  KB algorithm with slight modification is near-optimal. However, this existing algorithm
  suffers from feasibility issues due to its huge computational cost. Therefore, we
  propose a novel near-optimal algorithm called restarting phased elimination with
  random permutation (R-PERP), which bypasses the huge computational cost. A technical
  key point is the simple permutation procedures of query candidates, which enable
  us to derive a novel tighter confidence bound tailored to the non-stationary problems. "
