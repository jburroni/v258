abstract: " The objective of transfer learning is to enhance estimation and inference
  in a target data by leveraging knowledge gained from additional sources. Recent
  studies have explored transfer learning for independent observations in complex,
  high-dimensional models assuming sparsity, yet research on time series models remains
  limited. Our focus is on transfer learning for sequences of observations with temporal
  dependencies and a more intricate model parameter structure. Specifically, we investigate
  the vector autoregressive model (VAR), a widely recognized model for time series
  data, where the transition matrix can be deconstructed into a combination of a sparse
  matrix and a low-rank one. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm tailored
  for estimating high-dimensional VAR models characterized by low-rank and sparse
  structures. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting informative
  observations from auxiliary datasets. Theoretical guarantees are established, encompassing
  model parameter consistency, informative set selection, and the asymptotic distribution
  of estimators under mild conditions. The latter facilitates the construction of
  entry-wise confidence intervals for model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the
  empirical efficacy of our methodologies through both simulated and real-world datasets. "
