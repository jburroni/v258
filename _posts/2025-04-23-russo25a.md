title: Pure Exploration with Feedback Graphs
software: https://github.com/rssalessio/Pure-Exploration-with-Feedback-Graphs
openreview: ybpHHnBf7x
abstract: We study the sample complexity of pure exploration in an online learning
  problem with a feedback graph. This graph dictates the feedback available to the
  learner, covering scenarios between full-information, pure bandit feedback, and
  settings with no feedback on the chosen action. While variants of this problem have
  been investigated for regret minimization, no prior work has addressed the pure
  exploration setting, which is the focus of our study. We derive an instance-specific
  lower bound on the sample complexity of learning the best action with fixed confidence,
  even when the feedback graph is unknown and stochastic, and present unidentifiability
  results for Bernoulli rewards. Additionally, our findings reveal how the sample
  complexity scales with key graph-dependent quantities. Lastly, we introduce TaS-FG
  (Track and Stop for Feedback Graphs), an asymptotically optimal algorithm, and demonstrate
  its efficiency across different graph configurations.
