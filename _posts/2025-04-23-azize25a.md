title: 'Some Targets Are Harder to Identify than Others: Quantifying the Target-dependent
  Membership Leakage'
openreview: 0ebspjSSXk
abstract: In a Membership Inference (MI) game, an attacker tries to infer whether
  a target point was included or not in the input of an algorithm. Existing works
  show that some target points are easier to identify, while others are harder. This
  paper explains the target-dependent hardness of membership attacks by studying the
  powers of the optimal attacks in a \emph{fixed-target} MI game.  We characterise
  the optimal advantage and trade-off functions of attacks against the empirical mean
  in terms of the Mahalanobis distance between the target point and the data-generating
  distribution. We further derive the impacts of two privacy defences, i.e. adding
  Gaussian noise and sub-sampling, and that of target misspecification on optimal
  attacks. As by-products of our novel analysis of the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test,
  we provide a new covariance attack which generalises and improves the scalar product
  attack. Also, we propose a new optimal canary-choosing strategy for auditing privacy
  in the white-box federated learning setting. Our experiments validate that the Mahalanobis
  score explains the hardness of \emph{fixed-target} MI games.
