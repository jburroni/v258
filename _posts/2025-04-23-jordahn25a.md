abstract: " Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) often improve model calibration and predictive
  uncertainty quantification compared to point estimators such as maximum-a-posteriori
  (MAP). Similarly, deep ensembles (DEs) are also known to improve calibration, and
  therefore, it is natural to hypothesize that deep ensembles of BNNs (DE-BNNs) should
  provide even further improvements. In this work, we systematically investigate this
  across a number of datasets, neural network architectures, and BNN approximation
  methods and surprisingly find that when the ensembles grow large enough, DEs consistently
  outperform DE-BNNs on in-distribution data. To shine light on this observation,
  we conduct several sensitivity and ablation studies. Moreover, we show that even
  though DE-BNNs outperform DEs on out-of-distribution metrics, this comes at the
  cost of decreased in-distribution performance. As a final contribution, we open-source
  the large pool of trained models to facilitate further research on this topic. "
