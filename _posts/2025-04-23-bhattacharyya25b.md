title: Learning High-dimensional Gaussians from Censored Data
openreview: oMWasgN27d
abstract: 'We provide efficient algorithms for the problem of distribution learning
  from high-dimensional Gaussian data where in each sample, some of the variable values
  are missing. We suppose that the variables are {\em missing not at random (MNAR)}.
  The missingness model, denoted by $\mathbb{S}(\mathbf{y})$, is the function that
  maps any point $\mathbf{y}\in \mathbb{R}^d$ to the subsets of its coordinates that
  are seen. In this work, we assume that it is known. We study the following two settings:
  - [\textbf{Self-censoring}] An observation $\mathbf{x}$ is generated by first sampling
  the true value $\mathbf{y}$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}^*,
  \Sigma^*)$ with unknown $\mathbf{\mu}^*$ and $\Sigma^*$.  For each coordinate $i$,
  there exists a set $S_i\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $x_i=y_i$ if and only if
  $y_i\in S_i$. Otherwise, $x_i$ is missing and  takes a generic value (e.g “?").  We
  design an algorithm that learns $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}^*, \Sigma^*)$ up to TV
  distance $\varepsilon$, using $\textup{poly}(d, 1/\varepsilon)$ samples, assuming
  only that each pair of coordinates is observed with sufficiently high probability.  -
  [\textbf{Linear thresholding}] An observation $\mathbf{x}$ is generated by first
  sampling $\mathbf{y}$ from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}^*,
  \Sigma)$ with unknown $\mathbf{\mu}^*$ and known $\Sigma$, and then applying the
  missingness model $\mathbb{S}$ where $\mathbb{S}(\mathbf{y}) = \{i \in [d]: \mathbf{v}_i^T
  \mathbf{y} \leq b_i\}$ for some $\mathbf{v}_1, …, \mathbf{v}_d \in \mathbb{R}^d$
  and $b_1, …, b_d \in \mathbb{R}$.  We design an efficient mean estimation algorithm,
  assuming that none of the possible missingness patterns is very rare conditioned
  on the values of the observed coordinates and that any small subset of coordinates
  is observed with sufficiently high probability.'
