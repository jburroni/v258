title: " Linear Submodular Maximization with Bandit Feedback "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=g6Pv8jRgqu "
abstract: " Leveraging the intrinsic structure of submodular functions to design more
  sample-efficient algorithms for submodular maximization (SM) has gained significant
  attention in recent studies. In a number of real-world applications such as diversified
  recommender systems and data summarization, the submodular function exhibits additional
  linear structure. In this paper, we consider the problem of linear submodular maximization
  under the bandit feedback in the pure-exploration setting, where the submodular
  objective function is defined as $f:2^U \\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$, where
  $f=\\sum_{i=1}^dw_iF_{i}$. It is assumed that we have value oracle access to the
  functions $F_i$, but the coefficients $w_i$ are unknown, and $f$ can only be accessed
  via noisy queries. To harness the linear structure,  we develop algorithms inspired
  by adaptive allocation algorithms in the best-arm identification for the linear
  bandit, with approximation guarantees arbitrarily close to the setting where we
  have value oracle access to $f$. Our approach efficiently leverages information
  from prior samples, offering a significant improvement in sample efficiency. Experimental
  results on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
  performance of our method compared to baseline algorithms, particularly in terms
  of sample efficiency. "
