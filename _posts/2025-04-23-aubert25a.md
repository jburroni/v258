title: Model selection for behavioral learning data and applications to contextual
  bandits
software: https://github.com/JulienAubert3/ContextualBandits
openreview: uCs5QJRFSS
abstract: 'Learning for animals or humans is the process that leads to behaviors better
  adapted to the environment. This process highly depends on the individual that learns
  and is usually observed only through the individual’s actions. This article presents
  ways to use this individual behavioral data to find the model that best explains
  how the individual learns. We propose two model selection methods: a general hold-out
  procedure and an AIC-type criterion, both adapted to non-stationary dependent data.
  We provide theoretical error bounds for these methods that are close to those of
  the standard i.i.d. case. To compare these approaches, we apply them to contextual
  bandit models and illustrate their use on both synthetic and experimental learning
  data in a human categorization task.'
