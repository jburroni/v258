abstract: " Online reinforcement learning (RL) typically requires online interaction
  data to learn a policy for a target task, but collecting such data can be high-stakes.
  This prompts interest in leveraging historical data to improve sample efficiency.
  The historical data may come from outdated or related source environments with different
  dynamics. It remains unclear how to effectively use such data in the target task
  to provably enhance learning and sample efficiency. To address this, we propose
  a hybrid transfer RL (HTRL) setting, where an agent learns in a target environment
  while accessing offline data from a source environment with shifted dynamics. We
  show that – without information on the dynamics shift – general shifted-dynamics
  data, even with subtle shifts, does not reduce sample complexity in the target environment.
  \ However, focusing on HTRL with prior information on the degree of the dynamics
  shift, we design HySRL, a transfer algorithm that outperforms pure online RL with
  problem-dependent sample complexity guarantees. Finally, our experimental results
  demonstrate that HySRL surpasses the state-of-the-art pure online RL baseline. "
