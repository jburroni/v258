title: " A Subquadratic Time Approximation Algorithm for Individually Fair k-Center "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=sWLeL16ahT "
abstract: " We study the $k$-center problem in the context of individual fairness.
  Let $P$ be a set of $n$  points in a metric space and $r_x$ be the distance between
  $x \\in P$ and its $\\lceil n/k \\rceil$-th nearest neighbor. The problem asks to
  optimize the $k$-center objective under the constraint that, for every point $x$,
  there is a center within distance $r_x$.  We give bicriteria $(\\beta,\\gamma)$-approximation
  algorithms that compute clusterings such that every point $x \\in P$ has a center
  within distance $\\beta r_x$ and the clustering cost is at most $\\gamma$ times
  the optimal cost. Our main contributions are a deterministic $O(n^2+ kn \\log n)$
  \ time $(2,2)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized $O(nk\\log(n/\\delta)+k^2/\\varepsilon)$
  time $(10,2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm, where $\\delta$ denotes the
  failure probability. For the latter, we develop a randomized sampling procedure
  to compute constant factor approximations for the values $r_x$ for all $x\\in P$
  in subquadratic time; we believe this procedure to be of independent interest within
  the context of individual fairness. "
