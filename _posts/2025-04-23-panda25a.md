title: Copula Based Trainable Calibration Error Estimator of Multi-Label Classification
  with Label Interdependencies
software: https://github.com/highonai/CDEMLC.git
openreview: B86T1rjmff
abstract: A key challenge in calibrating Multi-Label Classification(MLC) problems
  is to consider the interdependencies among labels. To address this, in this research
  we propose an unbiased, differentiable, trainable calibration error estimator for
  MLC problems by using Copula. Unlike other methods for calibrating MLC tasks that
  focus on marginal calibration, this novel estimator takes label interdependencies
  into account and enables us to tackle the strictest notion of calibration that is
  canonical calibration. To design the estimator, we begin by leveraging the kernel
  trick to construct a continuous distribution from the discrete label space. Then
  we take a semiparametric approach to construct the estimator where the marginals
  are modeled non-parametrically and the Copula is modeled parametrically. Theoretically
  we show that our estimator is unbiased and converges to true $L^p$ calibration error.
  We also use our estimator as a regularizer at the time of training and observe that
  it reduces calibration error on test datasets significantly. Experiments on a well
  established dataset endorses our claims.
