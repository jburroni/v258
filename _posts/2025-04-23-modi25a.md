title: 'Batch, match, and patch: low-rank approximations for score-based variational
  inference'
software: https://github.com/modichirag/GSM-VI/
openreview: N6U1Ue7YgT
abstract: Black-box variational inference (BBVI) scales poorly to high-dimensional
  problems when it is used to estimate a multivariate Gaussian approximation with
  a full covariance matrix. In this paper, we extend the \emph{batch-and-match} (BaM)
  framework for score-based BBVI to problems where it is prohibitively expensive to
  store such covariance matrices, let alone to estimate them. Unlike classical algorithms
  for BBVI, which use stochastic gradient descent to minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler
  divergence, BaM uses more specialized updates to match the scores of the target
  density and its Gaussian approximation. We extend the updates for BaM by integrating
  them with a more compact parameterization of full covariance matrices. In particular,
  borrowing ideas from factor analysis, we add an extra step to each iteration of
  BaM—a \emph{patch}—that projects each newly updated covariance matrix into a more
  efficiently parameterized family of diagonal plus low rank matrices. We evaluate
  this approach on a variety of synthetic target distributions and real-world problems
  in high-dimensional inference.
