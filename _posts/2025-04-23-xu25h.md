title: " Understanding the Learning Dynamics of LoRA: A Gradient Flow Perspective
  on Low-Rank Adaptation in Matrix Factorization "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=hphdX8WlcT "
abstract: " Despite the empirical success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning
  pre-trained models, there is little theoretical understanding of how first-order
  methods with carefully crafted initialization adapt models to new tasks. In this
  work, we take the first step towards bridging this gap by theoretically analyzing
  the learning dynamics of LoRA for matrix factorization (MF) under gradient flow
  (GF), emphasizing the crucial role of initialization. For small initialization,
  we theoretically show that GF converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution,
  with smaller initialization leading to lower final error. Our analysis shows that
  the final error is affected by the misalignment between the singular spaces of the
  pre-trained model and the target matrix, and reducing the initialization scale improves
  alignment. To address this misalignment, we propose a spectral initialization for
  LoRA in MF and theoretically prove that GF with small spectral initialization converges
  to the fine-tuning task with arbitrary precision. Numerical experiments from MF
  and image classification validate our findings. "
