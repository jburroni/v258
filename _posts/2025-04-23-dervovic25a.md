title: " Model Evaluation in the Dark: Robust Classifier Metrics with Missing Labels "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=A91Za3oDo1 "
abstract: " Missing data in supervised learning is well-studied, but the specific
  issue of missing labels during model evaluation has been overlooked. Ignoring samples
  with missing values, a common solution, can introduce bias, especially when data
  is Missing Not At Random (MNAR). We propose a multiple imputation technique for
  evaluating classifiers using metrics such as precision, recall, and ROC-AUC. This
  method not only offers point estimates but also a predictive distribution for these
  quantities when labels are missing. We empirically show that the predictive distributionâ€™s
  location and shape are generally correct, even in the MNAR regime. Moreover, we
  establish that this distribution is approximately Gaussian and provide finite-sample
  convergence bounds. Additionally, a robustness proof is presented, confirming the
  validity of the approximation under a realistic error model. "
