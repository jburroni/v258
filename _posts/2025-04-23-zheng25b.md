abstract: " Time series forecasting is crucial across various fields such as economics,
  energy, transportation planning, and weather prediction. Nevertheless, accurately
  modeling real-world systems is challenging due to their inherent complexity and
  non-stationarity. Traditional methods, which often depend on high-dimensional embeddings,
  can obscure multivariate relationships and struggle with performance limitations,
  especially when handling complex temporal patterns.  To address these issues, we
  propose HAR-former, a Hybrid Transformer with an Adaptive Time-Frequency Representation
  Matrix, which combines the strengths of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Transformers
  to process trend and seasonal components, respectively. The HAR-former leverages
  a novel adaptive time-frequency representation matrix to bridge the gap between
  the time and frequency domains, allowing the model to capture both long-range dependencies
  and localized patterns. Extensive experimental evaluation on eight real-world benchmark
  datasets demonstrates that HAR-former outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
  methods, establishing it as a robust solution for complex time series forecasting
  tasks. "
