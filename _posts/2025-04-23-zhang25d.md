abstract: " In-Context Learning (ICL) ability has been found efficient across a wide
  range of applications, where the Large Language Models (LLM) learn to complete the
  tasks from the examples in the prompt without tuning the parameters. In this work,
  we conduct a comprehensive study to understand ICL from a statistical perspective.
  First, we show that the perfectly pretrained LLMs perform Bayesian Model Averaging
  (BMA) for ICL under a dynamic model of examples in the prompt. The average error
  analysis for ICL is then built for the perfectly pretrained LLMs with the analysis
  of BMA. Second, we demonstrate how the attention structure boosts the BMA implementation.
  With sufficient examples in the prompt, attention is proven to perform BMA under
  the Gaussian linear ICL model, which also motivates the explicit construction of
  the hidden concepts from the attention heads values. Finally, we analyze the pretraining
  behavior of LLMs. The pretraining error is decomposed as the generalization error
  and the approximation error. The generalization error is upper bounded via PAC-Bayes
  framework. Then the ICL average error of the pretrained LLMs is shown to be the
  sum of $O(T^{-1})$ and the pretraining error. In addition, we analyze the ICL performance
  of the pretrained LLMs with misspecified examples. "
