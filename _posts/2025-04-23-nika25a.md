title: Policy Teaching via Data Poisoning in Learning from Human Preferences
openreview: aKuEwftRiK
abstract: 'We study data poisoning attacks in learning from human preferences. More
  specifically, we consider the problem of teaching/enforcing a target policy $\pi^\dagger$
  by synthesizing preference data. We seek to understand the susceptibility of different
  preference-based learning paradigms to poisoned preference data by analyzing the
  number of samples required by the attacker to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. We first propose
  a general data poisoning formulation in learning from human preferences and then
  study it for two popular paradigms, namely: (a) reinforcement learning from human
  feedback (RLHF) that operates by learning a reward model using preferences; (b)
  direct preference optimization (DPO) that directly optimizes policy using preferences.
  We conduct a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of data poisoning in a setting
  where the attacker is allowed to augment a pre-existing dataset and also study its
  special case where the attacker can synthesize the entire preference dataset from
  scratch. As our main results, we provide lower/upper bounds on the number of samples
  required to enforce $\pi^\dagger$. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results
  in terms of the susceptibility of these learning paradigms under such data poisoning
  attacks.'
