title: An Iterative Algorithm for Rescaled Hyperbolic Functions Regression
openreview: xJU2GjcC1U
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have numerous real-life applications across
  various domains, such as natural language translation, sentiment analysis, language
  modeling, chatbots and conversational agents, creative writing, text classification,
  summarization, and generation. LLMs have shown great promise in improving the accuracy
  and efficiency of these tasks, and have the potential to revolutionize the field
  of natural language processing (NLP) in the years to come. Exponential function
  based attention unit is a fundamental element in LLMs. Several previous works have
  studied the convergence of exponential regression and softmax regression. In this
  paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve a rescaled version of the slightly
  different formulation of the softmax regression problem that arises in attention
  mechanisms of large language models. Specifically, we consider minimizing the squared
  loss between a certain function, which can be either the exponential function, hyperbolic
  sine function, or hyperbolic cosine function, and its inner product with a target
  $n$-dimensional vector $b$, scaled by the normalization term. This “rescaled softmax
  regression” differs from classical softmax regression in the location of the normalization
  factor. The efficiency and generalizability of this framework to multiple hyperbolic
  functions make it relevant for optimizing attention mechanisms. The analysis also
  leads to a corollary bounding solution changes under small perturbations for in-context
  learning. Limitations and societal impact are discussed.
