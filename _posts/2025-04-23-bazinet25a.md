abstract: " The sample compression theory provides generalization guarantees for predictors
  that can be fully defined using a subset of the training dataset and a (short) message
  string, generally defined as a binary sequence. Previous works provided generalization
  bounds for the zero-one loss, which is restrictive notably when applied to deep
  learning approaches. In this paper, we present a general framework for deriving
  new sample compression bounds that hold for real-valued unbounded losses. Using
  the Pick-To-Learn (P2L) meta-algorithm, which transforms the training method of
  any machine-learning predictor to yield sample-compressed predictors, we empirically
  demonstrate the tightness of the bounds and their versatility by evaluating them
  on random forests and multiple types of neural networks. "
