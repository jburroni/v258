abstract: We investigate a difference-of-convex (DC) formulation where the second
  term is allowed to be weakly convex. We examine the precise behavior of a single
  iteration of the difference-of-convex algorithm (DCA), providing a tight characterization
  of the objective function decrease, distinguishing between six distinct parameter
  regimes. Our proofs, inspired by the performance estimation framework, are notably
  simplified compared to related prior research. We subsequently derive sublinear
  convergence rates for the DCA towards critical points, assuming at least one of
  the functions is smooth. Additionally, we explore the underexamined equivalence
  between proximal gradient descent (PGD) and DCA iterations, demonstrating how DCA,
  a parameter-free algorithm, without the need for a stepsize, serves as a tool for
  studying the exact convergence rates of PGD. Finally, we propose a method to optimize
  the DC decomposition to achieve optimal convergence rates, potentially transforming
  the subtracted function to become weakly convex.
