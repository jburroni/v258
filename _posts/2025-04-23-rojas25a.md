title: Variational Schrödinger Momentum Diffusion
software: https://github.com/KevinRojas1499/Variational-Momentum-SB
openreview: mjnSTtc19o
abstract: The Momentum Schr{ö}dinger Bridge (mSB) (Chen et al., 2023c) has emerged
  as a leading method for accelerating generative diffusion processes and reducing
  transport costs. However, the lack of simulation-free properties inevitably results
  in high training costs and affects scalability. To obtain a trade-off between transport
  properties and scalability, we introduce variational Schrödinger momentum diffusion
  (VSMD), which employs linearized forward score functions (variational scores) to
  eliminate the dependence on simulated forward trajectories. Our approach leverages
  a multivariate diffusion process with adaptively transport-optimized variational
  scores. Additionally, we apply a critical-damping transform to stabilize training
  by removing the need for score estimations for both velocity and samples. Theoretically,
  we prove the convergence of samples generated with optimal variational scores and
  momentum diffusion. Empirical results demonstrate that VSMD efficiently generates
  anisotropic shapes while maintaining transport efficacy, outperforming overdamped
  alternatives, and avoiding complex denoising processes.  Our approach also scales
  effectively to real-world data, achieving competitive results in time series and
  image generation, both in unconditional and conditional settings.
