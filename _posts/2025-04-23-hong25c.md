abstract: " We study distributional off-policy evaluation (OPE), of which the goal
  is to learn the distribution of the return for a target policy using offline data
  generated by a different policy. The theoretical foundation of many existing work
  relies on the supremum-extended statistical distances such as supremum-Wasserstein
  distance, which are hard to estimate. In contrast, we study the more manageable
  expectation-extended statistical distances and provide a novel theoretical justification
  on their validity for learning the return distribution. Based on this attractive
  property, we propose a new method called Energy Bellman Residual Minimizer (EBRM)
  for distributional OPE. We provide corresponding in-depth theoretical analyses.
  We establish a finite-sample error bound for the EBRM estimator under the realizability
  assumption. Furthermore, we introduce a variant of our method based on a multi-step
  extension which improves the error bound for non-realizable settings. Notably, unlike
  prior distributional OPE methods, the theoretical guarantees of our method do not
  require the completeness assumption. "
