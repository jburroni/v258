title: " When Can We Solve the Weighted Low Rank Approximation Problem in Truly Subquadratic
  Time? "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=SQkur6MNOR "
abstract: " The weighted low-rank approximation problem is a fundamental numerical
  linear algebra problem and has many applications in machine learning. Given a $n
  \\times n$ weight matrix $W$ and a $n \\times n$ matrix $A$, the goal is to find
  two low-rank matrices $U, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$ such that the cost of
  $\\\\|{W} \\circ (U V^\\top - A) \\\\|_F^2$ is minimized. Previous work has to pay
  $\\Omega(n^2)$ time when matrices $A$ and $W$ are dense, e.g., having $\\Omega(n^2)$
  non-zero entries. In this work, we show that there is a certain regime, even if
  $A$ and $W$ are dense,  we can still hope to solve the weighted low-rank approximation
  problem in almost linear $n^{1+o(1)}$ time. "
