title: 'Class Imbalance in Anomaly Detection: Learning from an Exactly Solvable Model'
openreview: quw6Wxhu4B
abstract: 'Class imbalance (CI) is a longstanding problem in machine learning, slowing
  down training and reducing performances. Although empirical remedies exist, it is
  often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an overarching theory.
  We address a common case of imbalance, that of anomaly (or outlier) detection. We
  provide a theoretical framework to analyze, interpret and address CI. It is based
  on an exact solution of the teacher-student perceptron model, through replica theory.
  Within this framework, one can distinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic,
  train or test imbalance. Our analysis reveals that, depending on the specific problem
  setting, one source or another might dominate. We further find that the optimal
  train imbalance is generally different from 50%, with a non trivial dependence on
  the intrinsic imbalance, the abundance of data and on the noise in the learning.
  Moreover, there is a crossover between a small noise training regime where results
  are independent of the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly
  degrade with noise. Our results challenge some of the conventional wisdom on CI
  and pave the way for integrated approaches to the topic.'
