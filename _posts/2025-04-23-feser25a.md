title: " Strong Screening Rules for Group-based SLOPE Models "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=Jz3Oed8F0g "
abstract: " Tuning the regularization parameter in penalized regression models is
  an expensive task, requiring multiple models to be fit along a path of parameters.
  Strong screening rules drastically reduce computational costs by lowering the dimensionality
  of the input prior to fitting. We develop strong screening rules for group-based
  Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE) models: Group SLOPE and Sparse-group SLOPE.
  The developed rules are applicable to the wider family of group-based OWL models,
  including OSCAR. Our experiments on both synthetic and real data show that the screening
  rules significantly accelerate the fitting process. The screening rules make it
  accessible for group SLOPE and sparse-group SLOPE to be applied to high-dimensional
  datasets, particularly those encountered in genetics. "
