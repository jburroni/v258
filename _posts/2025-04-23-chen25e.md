abstract: " The assumption of independence between observations (units) in a dataset
  is prevalent across various methodologies for learning causal graphical models.
  However, this assumption often finds itself in conflict with real-world data, posing
  challenges to accurate structure learning. We propose a decorrelation-based approach
  for causal graph learning on dependent binary data, where the local conditional
  distribution is defined by a latent utility model with dependent errors across units.
  We develop a pairwise maximum likelihood method to estimate the covariance matrix
  for the dependence among the units. Then, leveraging the estimated covariance matrix,
  we develop an EM-like iterative algorithm to generate and de-correlate samples of
  the latent utility variables, which serve as de-correlated data. Any standard causal
  discovery method can be applied on the de-correlated data to learn the underlying
  causal graph. We demonstrate that the proposed de-correlation approach significantly
  improves the accuracy in causal graph learning, through numerical experiments on
  both synthetic and real-world datasets. "
