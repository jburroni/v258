title: A Safe Bayesian Learning Algorithm for Constrained MDPs with Bounded Constraint
  Violation
software: https://github.com/kalagarl/Safe_PSRL
openreview: GubPyzAW2l
abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) models are increasingly important
  in many applications with multiple objectives. When the model is unknown and must
  be learned online, it is desirable to ensure that the constraint is met, or at least
  the violation is bounded with time. In recent literature, progress has been made
  on this very challenging problem but with either unsatisfactory assumptions such
  as the knowledge of a safe policy, or have high cumulative regret. We propose the
  Safe-PSRL (posterior sampling-based RL) algorithm that does not need such assumptions
  and yet performs very well, both in terms of theoretical regret bounds as well as
  empirically. The algorithm efficiently trades-off exploration and exploitation using
  posterior sampling-based exploration, and yet provably suffers only bounded constraint
  violation using carefully-crafted pessimism. We establish a sub-linear $\tilde{O}(H^{2.5}\sqrt{|S|^2|A|K})$
  upper bound on the Bayesian objective regret along with a bounded, i.e., $\tilde{O}(1)$
  constraint-violation regret over  $K$  episodes for an  $|S|$-state, $|A|$-action,
  and $H$ horizon CMDP which improves over state-of-the-art algorithms for the same
  setting.
