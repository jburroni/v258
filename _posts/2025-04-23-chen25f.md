abstract: " Hyperbolic space naturally encodes hierarchical structures such as phylogenies
  (binary trees), where inward-bending geodesics reflect paths through least common
  ancestors, and the exponential growth of neighborhoods mirrors the super-exponential
  scaling of topologies. This scaling challenge limits the efficiency of Euclidean-based
  approximate Bayesian inference methods. Motivated by the geometric connections between
  trees and hyperbolic space, we develop novel hyperbolic extensions of two sequential
  search algorithms: Combinatorial and Nested Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo
  (\\textsc{Csmc} and \\textsc{Ncsmc}). Our approach introduces consistent and unbiased
  estimators, along with variational inference methods (\\textsc{H-Vcsmc} and \\textsc{H-Vncsmc}),
  which outperform their Euclidean counterparts. Empirical results demonstrate improved
  speed, scalability and performance in high-dimensional Bayesian phylogenetic inference
  tasks. "
