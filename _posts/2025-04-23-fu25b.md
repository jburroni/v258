abstract: " Satisfiability (SAT) solvers based on techniques such as conflict driven
  clause learning (CDCL) have produced excellent performance on both synthetic and
  real world industrial problems. While these CDCL solvers only operate on a per-problem
  basis, graph neural network (GNN) based solvers bring new benefits to the field
  by allowing practitioners to exploit knowledge gained from previously  solved problems
  to expedite solving of new SAT problems. However, one specific area that is often
  studied in the context of CDCL solvers, but largely overlooked in GNN solvers, is
  the relationship between graph theoretic measure of structure in SAT problems and
  the generalisation ability of GNN solvers. To bridge the gap between structural
  graph properties (e.g., modularity, self-similarity) and the generalisability (or
  lack thereof) of GNN based SAT solvers, we present StructureSAT: a curated dataset,
  along with code to further generate novel examples, containing a diverse set of
  SAT problems from well known problem domains. Furthermore, we utilise a novel splitting
  method that focuses on deconstructing the families into more detailed hierarchies
  based on their structural properties. With the new dataset, we aim to help explain
  problematic generalisation in existing GNN SAT solvers by exploiting knowledge of
  structural graph properties. We conclude with multiple future directions that can
  help researchers in GNN based SAT solving develop more effective and generalisable
  SAT solvers. "
