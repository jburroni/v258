abstract: " Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) allow to model arbitrarily complex mappings
  between inputs and mixture densities, enabling flexible conditional density estimation,
  at the risk of severe overfitting. A Bayesian approach can alleviate this problem
  by specifying a prior over the parameters of the neural network. However, these
  priors can be difficult to specify due to the lack of interpretability.  We propose
  a novel neural network construction for conditional mixture densities that allows
  one to specify the prior in the predictive distribution domain. The construction
  is based on mapping the targets to the unit hypercube via a diffeomorphism, enabling
  the use of mixtures of Beta distributions. We prove that the prior predictive distributions
  are calibrated in the sense that they are equal to the unconditional density function
  defined by the diffeomorphism.  Contrary to Bayesian Gaussian MDNs, which exhibit
  tied functional and distributional complexity, we show that our construction allows
  to decouple them. We propose an extension allowing to model correlations in the
  covariates via Gaussian copulas, potentially reducing the necessary number of mixture
  components. Our experiments show competitive performance on standard benchmarks
  with respect to the state of the art. "
