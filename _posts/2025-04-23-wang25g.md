title: Variance-Dependent Regret Bounds for Nonstationary Linear Bandits
openreview: H6Co3RbkGB
abstract: 'We investigate the non-stationary stochastic linear bandit problem where
  the reward distribution evolves each round. Existing algorithms characterize the
  non-stationarity by the total variation budget $B_K$, which is the summation of
  the change of the consecutive feature vectors of the linear bandits over $K$ rounds.
  However, such a quantity only measures the non-stationarity with respect to the
  expectation of the reward distribution, which makes existing algorithms sub-optimal
  under the general non-stationary distribution setting. In this work, we propose
  algorithms that utilize the  variance of the reward distribution as well as the
  $B_K$, and show that they can achieve tighter regret upper bounds. Specifically,
  we introduce two novel algorithms: Restarted Weighted$\text{OFUL}^+$ and Restarted
  $\text{SAVE}^+$. These algorithms address cases where the variance information of
  the rewards is known and unknown, respectively. Notably, when the total variance
  $V_K$ is much smaller than $K$, our algorithms outperform previous state-of-the-art
  results on non-stationary stochastic linear bandits under different settings. Experimental
  evaluations further validate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms
  over existing works.'
