abstract: The problem of counting subgraphs or graphlets under local differential
  privacy is an important challenge that has attracted significant attention from
  researchers. However, much of the existing work focuses on small graphlets like
  triangles or $k$-stars. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive, locally differentially
  private algorithm capable of counting graphlets of any size $k$. When $n$ is the
  number of nodes in the input graph, we show that the expected $\ell_2$ error of
  our algorithm is $O(n^{k - 1})$. Additionally, we prove that there exists a class
  of input graphs and graphlets of size $k$ for which any non-interactive counting
  algorithm incurs an expected $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1})$, demonstrating
  the optimality of our result. Furthermore, we establish that for certain input graphs
  and graphlets, any locally differentially private algorithm must have an expected
  $\ell_2$ error of $\Omega(n^{k - 1.5})$. Our experimental results show that our
  algorithm is more accurate than the classical randomized response method.
