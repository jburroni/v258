title: " A Convex Relaxation Approach to Generalization Analysis for Parallel Positively
  Homogeneous Networks "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=vHdKiqxZNk "
abstract: " We propose a general framework for deriving generalization bounds for
  parallel positively  homogeneous neural networksâ€“a class of neural networks whose
  input-output map decomposes as  the sum of positively homogeneous maps. Examples
  of such networks include matrix  factorization and sensing, single-layer multi-head
  attention mechanisms, tensor  factorization, deep linear and ReLU networks, and
  more. Our general framework is based on  linking the non-convex empirical risk minimization
  (ERM) problem to a closely related convex  optimization problem over prediction
  functions, which provides a global, achievable lower-bound to the ERM problem. We
  exploit this convex lower-bound to perform generalization  analysis in the convex
  space while controlling the discrepancy between the convex model and  its non-convex
  counterpart. We apply our general framework to a wide variety of models  ranging
  from low-rank matrix sensing, to structured matrix sensing, two-layer linear  networks,
  two-layer ReLU networks, and single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms,  achieving
  generalization bounds with a sample complexity that scales almost linearly with
  the  network width. "
