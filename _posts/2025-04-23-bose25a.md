abstract: We study the problem of representational transfer in offline Reinforcement
  Learning (RL), where a learner has access to episodic data from a number of source
  tasks collected a priori, and aims to learn a shared representation to be used in
  finding a good policy for a target task. Unlike in online RL where the agent interacts
  with the environment while learning a policy, in the offline setting there cannot
  be such interactions in either the source tasks or the target task; thus multi-task
  offline RL can suffer from incomplete coverage. We propose an algorithm to compute
  pointwise uncertainty measures for the learnt representation in low-rank MDPs, and
  establish a data-dependent upper bound for the suboptimality of the learnt policy
  for the target task. Our algorithm leverages the collective exploration done by
  source tasks to mitigate poor coverage at some points by a few tasks, thus overcoming
  the limitation of needing uniformly good coverage for a meaningful transfer by existing
  offline algorithms. We complement our theoretical results with empirical evaluation
  on a rich-observation MDP which requires many samples for complete coverage. Our
  findings illustrate the benefits of penalizing and quantifying the uncertainty in
  the learnt representation.
