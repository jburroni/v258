title: 'Q-learning for Quantile MDPs: A Decomposition, Performance, and Convergence
  Analysis'

abstract: In Markov decision processes (MDPs), quantile risk measures such as Value-at-Risk
  are a standard metric for modeling RL agentsâ€™ preferences for certain outcomes.
  This paper proposes a new Q-learning algorithm for quantile optimization in MDPs
  with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The algorithm leverages a new,
  simple dynamic program (DP) decomposition for quantile MDPs. Compared with prior
  work, our DP decomposition requires neither known transition probabilities nor solving
  complex saddle point equations and serves as a suitable foundation for other model-free
  RL algorithms. Our numerical results in tabular domains show that our Q-learning
  algorithm converges to its DP variant and outperforms earlier algorithms.
