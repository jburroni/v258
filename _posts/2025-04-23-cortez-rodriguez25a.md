abstract: " Estimating causal effects under interference is pertinent to many real-world
  settings. Recent work with low-order potential outcomes models uses a rollout design
  to obtain unbiased estimators that require no interference network information.
  However, the required extrapolation can lead to prohibitively high variance. To
  address this, we propose a two-stage experiment that selects a sub-population in
  the first stage and restricts treatment rollout to this sub-population in the second
  stage.  We explore the role of clustering in the first stage by analyzing the bias
  and variance of a polynomial interpolation-style estimator under this experimental
  design. Bias increases with the number of edges cut in the clustering of the interference
  network, but variance depends on qualities of the clustering that relate to homophily
  and covariate balance. There is a tension between clustering objectives that minimize
  the number of cut edges versus those that maximize covariate balance across clusters.
  \ Through simulations, we explore {a bias-variance} trade-off and compare the performance
  of the estimator under different clustering strategies. "
