abstract: " Learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) aims to train
  a binary classification model when only positive and unlabeled examples are available.
  \ Typically, learners assume that there is a labeling mechanism that determines
  which positive labels are observed. A particularly challenging setting arises when
  the observed positive labels are a biased sample from the positive distribution.
  Current approaches either require estimating the propensity scores, which are the
  instance-specific probabilities that a positive example’s label will be observed,
  or make overly restricting assumptions about the labeling mechanism. We make a novel
  assumption about the labeling mechanism which we show is more general than several
  commonly used existing ones. Moreover, the combination of our novel assumption and
  theoretical results from robust statistics can simplify the process of learning
  from biased PU data. Empirically, our approach offers superior predictive and run
  time performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. "
