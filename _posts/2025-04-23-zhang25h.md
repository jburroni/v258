abstract: We revisit the likelihood ratio between a pretrained large language model
  (LLM) and its finetuned variant as a criterion for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.
  The intuition behind such a criterion is that, the pretrained LLM has the prior
  knowledge about OOD data due to its large amount of training data, and once finetuned
  with the in-distribution data, the LLM has sufficient knowledge to distinguish their
  difference. Leveraging the power of LLMs, we show that, the likelihood ratio can
  serve as an effective OOD detection criterion. Moreover, we apply the proposed LLM-based
  likelihood ratio to detect OOD questions in question-answering (QA) systems, which
  can be used to improve the performance of specialized LLMs for general questions.
  Given that likelihood can be easily obtained by the loss functions within contemporary
  neural network frameworks, it is straightforward to implement this approach in practice
  with \textbf{three lines} of code. Since both the pretrained LLMs and its various
  finetuned models are widely available from online platforms such as Hugging Face,
  our proposed criterion can be effortlessly incorporated for OOD detection without
  the need for further training. We conduct comprehensive evaluation across on multiple
  settings, including far OOD, near OOD, spam detection, and QA scenarios, to demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the method. Code can be found at \url{https://github.com/andiac/LLMOODratio}
