title: The Sample Complexity of Stackelberg Games
openreview: 7lccoXFMVh
abstract: Stackelberg games (SGs) constitute the most fundamental and acclaimed models
  of strategic interactions involving some form of commitment. Moreover, they form
  the basis of more elaborate models of this kind, such as, e.g., Bayesian persuasion
  and principal-agent problems. Addressing learning tasks in SGs and related models
  is crucial to operationalize them in practice, where model parameters are usually
  unknown. In this paper, we revise the sample complexity of learning an optimal strategy
  to commit to in SGs. We provide a novel algorithm that (i) does not require any
  of the limiting assumptions made by state-of-the-art approaches and (ii) deals with
  a trade-off between sample complexity and termination probability arising when leaderâ€™s
  strategies representation has finite precision. Such a trade-off has been completely
  neglected by existing algorithms and, if not properly managed, it may result in
  them using exponentially-many samples. Our algorithm requires novel techniques,
  which also pave the way to addressing learning problems in other models with commitment
  ubiquitous in the real world.
