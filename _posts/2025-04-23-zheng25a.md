abstract: " Nearly all identifiability results in unsupervised representation learning
  inspired by, e.g., independent component analysis, factor analysis, and causal representation
  learning, rely on assumptions of additive independent noise or noiseless regimes.
  In contrast, we study the more general case where noise can take arbitrary forms,
  depend on latent variables, and be non-invertibly entangled within a nonlinear function.
  We propose a general framework for identifying latent variables in the nonparametric
  noisy settings. We first show that, under suitable conditions, the generative model
  is identifiable up to certain submanifold indeterminacies even in the presence of
  non-negligible noise. Furthermore, under the structural or distributional variability
  conditions, we prove that latent variables of the general nonlinear models are identifiable
  up to trivial indeterminacies. Based on the proposed theoretical framework, we have
  also developed corresponding estimation methods and validated them in various synthetic
  and real-world settings. Interestingly, our estimate of the true GDP growth from
  alternative measurements suggests more insightful information on the economies than
  official reports. We expect our framework to provide new insight into how both researchers
  and practitioners deal with latent variables in real-world scenarios. "
