title: Enhanced Adaptive Gradient Algorithms for Nonconvex-PL Minimax Optimization
openreview: jj1o2SD3PB
abstract: Minimax optimization recently is widely applied in many machine learning
  tasks such as generative adversarial networks, robust learning and reinforcement
  learning. In the paper, we study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization
  with nonsmooth regularization, where the objective function is possibly nonconvex
  on primal variable $x$, and it is nonconcave and satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz
  (PL) condition on dual variable $y$. Moreover, we propose a class of enhanced momentum-based
  gradient descent ascent methods (i.e., MSGDA and AdaMSGDA) to solve these stochastic
  nonconvex-PL minimax problems. In particular, our AdaMSGDA algorithm can use various
  adaptive learning rates in updating the variables $x$ and $y$ without relying on
  any specifical types. Theoretically, we prove that our methods have the best known
  sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ only requiring one sample at each
  loop in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Some numerical experiments on
  PL-game and Wasserstein-GAN demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.
