abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to coordinate
  multiple agents to achieve a common goal. A key challenge in MARL is credit assignment,
  which involves assessing each agent’s contribution to the shared reward. Given the
  diversity of tasks, agents may perform different types of coordination, with rewards
  attributed to diverse and often overlapping agent subsets. In this work, we formalize
  the credit assignment level as the number of agents cooperating to obtain a reward,
  and address scenarios with multiple coexisting levels. We introduce a multi-level
  advantage formulation that performs explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits
  across distinct levels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA),
  captures agent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions
  that reason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an attention-based
  framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and constructs multi-level
  advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive experiments on challenging Starcraft
  v1 & v2 tasks demonstrate MACA’s superior performance, underscoring its efficacy
  in complex credit assignment scenarios.
