title: 'Data Reconstruction Attacks and Defenses: A Systematic Evaluation'
openreview: eq87myBFi3
abstract: Reconstruction attacks and defenses are essential in understanding the data
  leakage problem in machine learning. However, prior work has centered around empirical
  observations of gradient inversion attacks, lacks theoretical grounding, and cannot
  disentangle the usefulness of defending methods from the computational limitation
  of attacking methods. In this work, we propose to view the problem as an inverse
  problem, enabling us to theoretically and systematically evaluate the data reconstruction
  attack. On various defense methods, we derived the algorithmic upper bound and the
  matching (in feature dimension and architecture dimension) information-theoretical
  lower bound on the reconstruction error for two-layer neural networks. To complement
  the theoretical results and investigate the utility-privacy trade-off, we defined
  a natural evaluation metric of the defense methods with similar utility loss among
  the strongest attacks. We further propose a strong reconstruction attack that helps
  update some previous understanding of the strength of defense methods under our
  proposed evaluation metric.
