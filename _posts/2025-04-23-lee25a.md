title: A Theoretical Framework for Preventing Class Collapse in Supervised Contrastive
  Learning

openreview: ElvhiUFA02
abstract: Supervised contrastive learning (SupCL) has emerged as a prominent approach
  in representation learning, leveraging both supervised and self-supervised losses.
  However, achieving an optimal balance between these losses is challenging; failing
  to do so can lead to class collapse, reducing discrimination among individual embeddings
  in the same class. In this paper, we present theoretically grounded guidelines for
  SupCL to prevent class collapse in learned representations. Specifically, we introduce
  the Simplex-to-Simplex Embedding Model (SSEM), a theoretical framework that models
  various embedding structures, including all embeddings that minimize the supervised
  contrastive loss. Through SSEM, we analyze how hyperparameters affect learned representations,
  offering practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection to mitigate the risk
  of class collapse. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical results across
  synthetic and real-world datasets.
