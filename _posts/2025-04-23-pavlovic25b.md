title: " Order-Optimal Regret in Distributed Kernel Bandits using Uniform Sampling
  with Shared Randomness "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1lH2YaR3O "
abstract: " We consider distributed kernel bandits where $N$ agents aim to collaboratively
  maximize an unknown reward function that lies in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
  Each agent sequentially queries the function to obtain noisy observations at the
  query points. Agents can share information through a central server, with the objective
  of minimizing regret that is accumulating over time $T$ and aggregating over agents.
  We develop the first algorithm that achieves the optimal regret order (as defined
  by centralized learning) with a communication cost that is sublinear in both $N$
  and $T$. The key features of the proposed algorithm are the uniform exploration
  at the local agents and shared randomness with the central server. Working together
  with the sparse approximation of the GP model, these two key components make it
  possible to preserve the learning rate of the centralized setting at a diminishing
  rate of communication. "
