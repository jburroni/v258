  Flows "

abstract: " Modeling distributions that depend on external control parameters is a
  common scenario in diverse applications like molecular simulations, where system
  properties like temperature affect molecular configurations. Despite the relevance
  of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely
  restricted model architectures or rely on energy-based training, which is prone
  to instability. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating
  the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model
  for a specific condition using either i.i.d.Â samples or backward KL training, we
  establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other
  conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external
  parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks,
  allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive
  assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results
  in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations
  to physical lattice models. "
