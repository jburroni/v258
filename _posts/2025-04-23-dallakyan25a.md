title: Generalized Criterion for Identifiability of Additive Noise Models Using Majorization

openreview: 14C3JhW2jk
abstract: The discovery of causal relationships from observational data is very challenging.
  Many recent approaches rely on complexity or uncertainty concepts to impose constraints
  on probability distributions, aiming to identify specific classes of directed acyclic
  graph (DAG) models. In this paper, we introduce a novel identifiability criterion
  for DAGs that places constraints on the conditional variances of additive noise
  models. We demonstrate that this criterion extends and generalizes existing identifiability
  criteria in the literature that employ (conditional) variances as measures of uncertainty
  in (conditional) distributions. For linear structural equation models, we present
  a new algorithm that leverages the concept of weak majorization applied to the diagonal
  elements of the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix to learn a topological
  ordering of variables. Through extensive simulations and the analysis of bank connectivity
  data, we provide evidence of the effectiveness of our approach in successfully recovering
  DAGs. The code for reproducing the results in this paper is available in Supplementary
  Materials.
