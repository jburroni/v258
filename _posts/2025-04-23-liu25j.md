abstract: " We introduce ScoreFusion, a theoretically grounded method for fusing multiple
  pre-trained diffusion models that are assumed to generate from auxiliary populations.
  ScoreFusion is particularly useful for enhancing the generative modeling of a target
  population with limited observed data. Our starting point considers the family of
  KL barycenters of the auxiliary populations, which is proven to be an optimal parametric
  class in the KL sense, but difficult to learn. Nevertheless, by recasting the learning
  problem as score matching in denoising diffusion, we obtain a tractable way of computing
  the optimal KL barycenter weights. We prove a dimension-free sample complexity bound
  in total variation distance, provided that the auxiliary models are well-fitted
  for their own task and the auxiliary tasks combined capture the target well. The
  sample efficiency of ScoreFusion is demonstrated by learning handwritten digits.
  We also provide a simple adaptation of a Stable Diffusion denoising pipeline that
  enables sampling from the KL barycenter of two auxiliary checkpoints; on a portrait
  generation task, our method produces faces that enhance population heterogeneity
  relative to the auxiliary distributions. "
