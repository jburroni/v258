abstract: " We develop a mathematical framework to address a broad class of metric
  and preference learning problems within a Hilbert space. We obtain a novel representer
  theorem for the simultaneous task of metric and preference learning. Our key observation
  is that the representer theorem for this task can be derived by regularizing the
  problem with respect to the norm inherent in the task structure. For the general
  task of metric learning, our framework leads to a simple and self-contained representer
  theorem and offers new geometric insights into the derivation of representer theorems
  for this task. In the case of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs), we illustrate
  how our representer theorem can be used to express the solution of the learning
  problems in terms of finite kernel terms similar to classical representer theorems.
  Lastly, our representer theorem leads to a novel nonlinear algorithm for metric
  and preference learning. We compare our algorithm against challenging baseline methods
  on real-world rank inference benchmarks, where it achieves competitive performance.
  Notably, our approach significantly outperforms vanilla ideal point methods and
  surpasses strong baselines across multiple datasets. Code available at: \\url{https://github.com/PeymanMorteza/Metric-Preference-Learning-RKHS} "
