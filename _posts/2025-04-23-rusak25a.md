title: 'InfoNCE: Identifying the Gap Between Theory and Practice'
openreview: RNQzrXWhIs
abstract: Prior theory work on Contrastive Learning via the InfoNCE loss showed that,
  under certain assumptions, the learned representations recover the ground-truth
  latent factors. We argue that these theories overlook crucial aspects of how CL
  is deployed in practice. Specifically, they either assume equal variance across
  all latents or that certain latents are kept invariant. However, in practice, positive
  pairs are often generated using augmentations such as strong cropping to just a
  few pixels. Hence, a more realistic assumption is that all latent factors change
  with a continuum of variability across all factors. We introduce AnInfoNCE, a generalization
  of InfoNCE that can provably uncover the latent factors in this anisotropic setting,
  broadly generalizing previous identifiability results in CL. We validate our identifiability
  results in controlled experiments and show that AnInfoNCE increases the recovery
  of previously collapsed information in CIFAR10 and ImageNet, albeit at the cost
  of downstream accuracy.  Finally, we discuss the remaining mismatches between theoretical
  assumptions and practical implementations.
