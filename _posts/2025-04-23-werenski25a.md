abstract: " We propose the linear barycentric coding model (LBCM) which utilizes the
  linear optimal transport (LOT) metric for analysis and synthesis of probability
  measures.  We provide a closed-form solution to the variational problem characterizing
  the probability measures in the LBCM and establish equivalence of the LBCM to the
  set of 2-Wasserstein barycenters in the special case of compatible measures. Computational
  methods for synthesizing and analyzing measures in the LBCM are developed with finite
  sample guarantees. One of our main theoretical contributions is to identify an LBCM,
  expressed in terms of a simple family, which is sufficient to express all probability
  measures on the closed unit interval.  We show that a natural analogous construction
  of an LBCM in 2 dimensions fails, and we leave it as an open problem to identify
  the proper extension in more than 1 dimension.  We conclude by demonstrating the
  utility of LBCM for covariance estimation and data imputation. "
