abstract: " Recently, variance exploding (VE) diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art
  (SOTA) performance in two implementations: (1) the SDE-based implementation and
  (2) the probability flow ODE (PFODE) implementation. However, only a few works analyze
  the iteration complexity of VE-based models, and most focus on SDE-based implementation
  with strong assumptions. In this work, we prove the first polynomial iteration complexity
  under the realistic bounded support assumption for these two implementations. For
  the SDE-based implementation, we explain why the current SOTA VE-based model performs
  better than previous VE models. After that, we provide an improved result under
  the linear subspace data assumption and explain the great performance of VE models
  under the manifold data. For the PFODE-based implementation, the current results
  depend exponentially on problem parameters. Inspired by the previous predictor-corrector
  analysis framework, we propose the PFODE-Corrector algorithm and prove the polynomial
  complexity for the basic algorithm with uniform stepsize. After that, we show that
  VE-based models are more suitable for large stepsize and propose an exponential-decay
  stepsize version algorithm to improve the results. "
