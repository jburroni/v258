abstract: " Federated Learning (FL) involves a server aggregating local models from
  clients to compute a global model. However, this process can struggle to position
  the global model in low-loss regions of the parameter space for all clients, resulting
  in subpar convergence and inequitable performance across clients. This issue is
  particularly pronounced in non-IID settings, common in clinical contexts, where
  variations in data distribution, class imbalance, and training sample sizes result
  in client heterogeneity. To address this issue, we propose a mode connectivity-based
  FL framework that ensures the global model resides within the overlapping low-loss
  regions of all clients in the parameter space. This framework models the low-loss
  regions as non-linear mode connections between the current global and local models,
  and optimises to identify an intersection among these mode connections to define
  the new global model. This approach enhances training stability and convergence,
  yielding better and more equitable performance compared to standard FL frameworks
  like federated averaging. Empirical evaluations across multiple healthcare datasets
  demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework. "
