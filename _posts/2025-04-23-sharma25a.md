title: " Decision-Point Guided Safe Policy Improvement "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=hbknVIJf2W "
abstract: " Within batch reinforcement learning, safe policy improvement seeks to
  ensure that the learned policy performs at least as well as the behavior policy
  that generated the dataset.  The core challenge is seeking improvements while balancing
  risk when many state-action pairs may be infrequently visited.  In this work, we
  introduce Decision Points RL (DPRL), an algorithm that restricts the set of state-action
  pairs (or regions for continuous states) considered for improvement. DPRL ensures
  high-confidence improvement in densely visited states (called ‘decision points’)
  while still utilizing data from sparsely visited states by using them for trajectory-based
  value estimates. By selectively limiting the state-actions where the policy deviates
  from the behavior, we achieve tighter theoretical guarantees that depend only on
  the counts of frequently observed state-action pairs rather than on state-action
  space size. Our empirical results confirm DPRL provides both safety and performance
  improvements across synthetic and real-world applications. "
