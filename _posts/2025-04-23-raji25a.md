abstract: " Automated decision systems (ADS) are broadly deployed to inform or support
  human decision- making across a wide range of consequential contexts. However, various
  context-specific details complicate the goal of establishing meaningful experimental
  evaluations for prediction-based interventions. Notably, specific experimental design
  decisions may induce cognitive biases in human decision makers, which could then
  significantly alter the observed effect sizes of the prediction intervention. In
  this paper, we formalize and investigate various models of human decision-making
  in the presence of a predictive model aid. We show that each of these behavioral
  models produces dependencies across decision subjects and results in the violation
  of existing assumptions, with consequences for treatment effect estimation. This
  work aims to further advance the scientific validity of intervention-based evaluation
  schemes for the assessment of ADS deployments. "
