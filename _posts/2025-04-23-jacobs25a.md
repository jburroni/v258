title: Estimation of Large Zipfian Distributions with Sort and Snap
software: https://github.com/jacobs269/zipfianPaper
openreview: 1DH5pxs3xg
abstract: We study the estimation of Zipfian distributions under $L_1$ loss, and provide
  near minimax optimal bounds in several regimes.  Specifically, we assume observations
  arrive from a known alphabet, and with a known decay rate parametrizing the Zipfian,
  but we do not know a priori which alphabet elements have larger probability than
  others.  We present a novel Sort and Snap estimator, which uses the empirical proportions
  to sort the alphabet, and then snaps them to the associated term from the Zipfian
  distribution.  For arbitrary decay rates and smaller alphabet sizes, as well as
  for large decay rates and large alphabet sizes, we show an exact or minor variant
  of this estimator is near minimax optimal and has exponential improvement over the
  standard empirical proportion estimator. However, for small decay rates and larger
  alphabet sizes a simulation study indicates the standard empirical proportion estimator
  is competitive with Sort and Snap procedures. In addition to providing nearly tight
  bounds for important high-dimensional estimation problems, we believe the Sort and
  Snap estimator, and its analysis, will have independent interest.
