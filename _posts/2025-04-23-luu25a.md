abstract: 'The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is often lauded for its ability
  to effectively sample from high-dimensional distributions. In this paper we challenge
  the presumed domination of HMC for the Bayesian analysis of GLMs. By utilizing the
  structure of the compute graph rather than the graphical model, we show a reduction
  of the time per sweep of a full-scan Gibbs sampler from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$, where
  $d$ is the number of GLM parameters. A simple change to the implementation of the
  Gibbs sampler allow us to perform Bayesian inference on high-dimensional GLMs that
  are practically infeasible with traditional Gibbs sampler implementations. We empirically
  demonstrate a substantial increase in effective sample size per time when comparing
  our Gibbs algorithms to state-of-the-art HMC algorithms. While Gibbs is superior
  in terms of dimension scaling, neither Gibbs nor HMC dominate the other: we provide
  numerical and theoretical evidence that HMC retains an edge in certain circumstances
  thanks to its advantageous condition number scaling. Interestingly, for GLMs of
  fixed data size, we observe that increasing dimensionality can stabilize or even
  decrease condition number, shedding light on the empirical advantage of our efficient
  Gibbs sampler.'
