title: " Geometric Collaborative Filtering with Convergence "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=m1KT9KefLp "
abstract: " Latent variable collaborative filtering methods have been a standard approach
  to modelling user-click interactions due to their simplicity and effectiveness.
  However, there is limited work on analyzing the mathematical properties of these
  methods in particular on preventing the overfitting towards the identity, and such
  methods typically utilize loss functions that overlook the geometry between items.
  In this work, we introduce a notion of generalization gap in collaborative filtering
  and analyze this with respect to latent collaborative filtering models. We present
  a geometric upper bound that gives rise to loss functions, and a way to meaningfully
  utilize the geometry of the items to improve recommendations. We show how these
  losses can be minimized and gives the recipe to a new latent collaborative filtering
  algorithm, which we refer to as GeoCF, due to the geometric nature of our results.
  We then show experimentally that our proposed GeoCF algorithm can outperform other
  all existing methods on the Movielens20M and Netflix datasets, as well as two large-scale
  internal datasets. In summary, our work proposes a theoretically sound method which
  paves a way to better understand generalization of collaborative filtering at large. "
