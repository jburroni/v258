title: Variance-Aware Linear UCB with Deep Representation for Neural Contextual Bandits
software: https://github.com/Angie-Lab-JHU/neuralVarLinUCB
openreview: 2cZ1xs5UUL
abstract: By leveraging the representation power of deep neural networks, neural upper
  confidence bound (UCB) algorithms have shown success in contextual bandits. To further
  balance the exploration and exploitation, we propose Neural-$\sigma^2$-LinearUCB,
  a variance-aware algorithm that utilizes $\sigma^2_t$, i.e., an upper bound of the
  reward noise variance at round $t$, to enhance the uncertainty quantification quality
  of the UCB, resulting in a regret performance improvement. We provide an oracle
  version for our algorithm characterized by an oracle variance upper bound $\sigma^2_t$
  and a practical version with a novel estimation for this variance bound. Theoretically,
  we provide rigorous regret analysis for both versions and prove that our oracle
  algorithm achieves a better regret guarantee than other neural-UCB algorithms in
  the neural contextual bandits setting. Empirically, our practical method enjoys
  a similar computational efficiency, while outperforming state-of-the-art techniques
  by having a better calibration and lower regret across multiple standard settings,
  including on the synthetic, UCI, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.
