title: The cost of local and global fairness in Federated Learning

abstract: 'With the emerging application of Federated Learning (FL) in finance, hiring
  and healthcare, FL models are regulated to be fair, preventing disparities with
  respect to legally protected attributes such as race or gender.  Two concepts of
  fairness are important in FL: global and local fairness.  Global fairness addresses
  the disparity across the entire population and local fairness is concerned with
  the disparity within each client.  Prior fair FL frameworks have improved either
  global or local fairness without considering both.  Furthermore, while the majority
  of studies on fair FL focuses on binary settings, many real-world applications are
  multi-class problems. This paper proposes a framework that investigates  the minimum
  accuracy lost for enforcing a specified level of global and local fairness in  multi-class
  FL settings. Our framework leads to a simple post-processing algorithm that derives
  fair outcome predictors from the Bayesian optimal score functions. Experimental
  results show that our algorithm outperforms the current state of the art (SOTA)
  with regard to the accuracy-fairness tradoffs, computational and communication costs.
