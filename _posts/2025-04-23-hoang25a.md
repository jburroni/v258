abstract: " Bayesian optimization (BO) is a leading method for optimizing expensive
  black-box optimization and has been successfully applied across various scenarios.
  However, BO suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making it challenging to scale
  to high-dimensional problems. Existing work has adopted a variable selection strategy
  to select and optimize only a subset of variables iteratively. Although this approach
  can mitigate the high-dimensional challenge in BO, it still leads to sample inefficiency.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel method that identifies important variables
  by estimating the length scales of Gaussian process kernels. Next, we construct
  an effective search region consisting of multiple subspaces and optimize the acquisition
  function within this region, focusing on only the important variables. We demonstrate
  that our proposed method achieves cumulative regret with a sublinear growth rate
  in the worst case while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments on high-dimensional
  synthetic functions and real-world problems show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance. "
