abstract: " Motivated by monitoring the arrival of incoming adverse events such as
  customer support calls or crash events from users exposed to an experimental product
  change, we consider sequential hypothesis testing of continuous-time counting processes.
  Specifically, we provide a multivariate confidence process on the cumulative rates
  $(\\Lambda^A_t, \\Lambda^B_t)$ giving an anytime-valid coverage guarantee $\\mathbb{P}[(\\Lambda^A_t,
  \\Lambda^B_t) \\in C^\\alpha_t \\, \\forall t >0] \\geq 1-\\alpha$. This provides
  simultaneous confidence process on $\\Lambda^A_t$, $\\Lambda^B_t$ and their difference
  $\\Lambda^B_t-\\Lambda^A_t$, allowing each arm of the experiment and the difference
  between them to be safely monitored throughout the experiment. We extend our results
  by constructing a closed-form $e$-process for testing the equality of rates with
  a time-uniform Type-I error guarantee at a nominal $\\alpha$. We characterize the
  asymptotic growth rate of the proposed $e$-process under the alternative and show
  that it has power 1 when the average rates of the two process differ in the limit. "
