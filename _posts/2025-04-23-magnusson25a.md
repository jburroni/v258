title: 'posteriordb: Testing, Benchmarking and Developing Bayesian Inference Algorithms'
software: https://github.com/stan-dev/posteriordb
openreview: WVX8tPoPYO
abstract: The general applicability and robustness of posterior inference algorithms
  is critical to widely used probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, PyMC,
  Pyro, and Turing.jl. When designing a new inference algorithm, whether it involves
  Monte Carlo sampling or variational approximation, the fundamental problem is evaluating
  its accuracy and efficiency across a range of representative target posteriors.
  To solve this problem, we propose posteriordb, a database of models and data sets
  defining target densities along with reference Monte Carlo draws. We further provide
  a guide to the best practices in using posteriordb for algorithm evaluation and
  comparison. To provide a wide range of realistic posteriors, posteriordb currently
  comprises 120 representative models with data, and has been instrumental in developing
  several inference algorithms.
