title: On the Difficulty of Constructing a Robust and Publicly-Detectable Watermark
openreview: bDuNZJ6O8N
abstract: This work investigates the theoretical boundaries of creating publicly-detectable
  schemes to enable the provenance of watermarked imagery. Metadata-based approaches
  like C2PA provide unforgeability and public-detectability. ML techniques offer robust
  retrieval and watermarking. However, no existing scheme combines robustness, unforgeability,
  and public-detectability. In this work, we formally define such a scheme and establish
  its existence. Although theoretically possible, we find that at present, it is intractable
  to build certain components of our scheme without a leap in deep learning capabilities.
  We analyze these limitations and propose research directions that need to be addressed
  before we can practically realize robust and publicly-verifiable provenance.
