abstract: " Saliency maps have been widely used to interpret the decisions of neural
  network classifiers and discover phenomena from their learned functions. However,
  standard gradient-based maps are frequently observed to be highly sensitive to the
  randomness of training data and the stochasticity in the training process. In this
  work, we study the role of Gaussian smoothing in the well-known Smooth-Grad algorithm
  in the stability of the gradient-based maps to the randomness of training samples.
  We extend the algorithmic stability framework to gradient-based interpretation maps
  and prove bounds on the stability error of standard Simple-Grad, Integrated-Gradients,
  and Smooth-Grad saliency maps. Our theoretical results suggest the role of Gaussian
  smoothing in boosting the stability of gradient-based maps to the randomness of
  training settings. On the other hand, we analyze the faithfulness of the Smooth-Grad
  maps to the original Simple-Grad and show the lower fidelity under a more intense
  Gaussian smoothing. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical
  experiments on standard image datasets. Our empirical results confirm our hypothesis
  on the fidelity-stability trade-off in the application of Gaussian smoothing to
  gradient-based interpretation maps. "
