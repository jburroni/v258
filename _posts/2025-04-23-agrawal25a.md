title: Disentangling impact of capacity, objective, batchsize, estimators, and step-size
  on flow VI
openreview: 9zrByMY8DY
abstract: 'Normalizing flow-based variational inference (flow VI) is a promising approximate
  inference approach, but its performance remains inconsistent across studies. Numerous
  algorithmic choices influence flow VIâ€™s performance. We conduct a step-by-step analysis
  to disentangle the impact of some of the key factors: capacity, objectives, gradient
  estimators, number of gradient estimates (batchsize), and step-sizes. Each step
  examines one factor while neutralizing others using insights from the previous steps
  and/or using extensive parallel computation. To facilitate high-fidelity evaluation,
  we curate a benchmark of synthetic targets that represent common posterior pathologies
  and allow for exact sampling. We provide specific recommendations for different
  factors and propose a flow VI recipe that matches or surpasses leading turnkey Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo (HMC) methods.'
