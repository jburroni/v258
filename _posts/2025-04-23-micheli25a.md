title: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Bayesian Optimization with Continuous Context
software: https://github.com/frmicheli/WDRBO
openreview: bzR0v2VdEc
abstract: We address the challenge of sequential data-driven decision-making under
  context distributional uncertainty. This problem arises in numerous real-world scenarios
  where the learner optimizes black-box objective functions in the presence of uncontrollable
  contextual variables. We consider the setting where the context distribution is
  uncertain but known to lie within an ambiguity set defined as a ball in the Wasserstein
  distance. We propose a novel algorithm for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Bayesian
  Optimization that can handle continuous context distributions while maintaining
  computational tractability. Our theoretical analysis combines recent results in
  self-normalized concentration in Hilbert spaces and finite-sample bounds for distributionally
  robust optimization to establish sublinear regret bounds that match state-of-the-art
  results. Through extensive comparisons with existing approaches on both synthetic
  and real-world problems, we demonstrate the simplicity, effectiveness, and practical
  applicability of our proposed method.
