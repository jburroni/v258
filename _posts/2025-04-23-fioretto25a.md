title: 'Differentially Private Graph Data Release: Inefficiencies & Unfairness'

abstract: Networks in sectors like telecommunications and transportation often contain
  sensitive user data, requiring privacy enhancing technologies during data release
  to ensure privacy. While Differential Privacy (DP) is recognized as the leading
  standard for privacy preservation, its use comes with new challenges, as the noise
  added for privacy introduces inaccuracies or biases. DP techniques have also been
  found to distribute these biases disproportionately across different populations,
  inducing fairness issues. This paper investigates the effects of DP on bias and
  fairness when releasing network edge weights. We specifically examine how these
  privacy measures affect decision-making tasks, such as computing shortest paths,
  which are crucial for routing in transportation and communications networks, and
  provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence on the inherent trade-offs
  between privacy, accuracy, and fairness for network data release.
