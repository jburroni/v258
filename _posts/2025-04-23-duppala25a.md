abstract: " We study the canonical fair clustering problem where each cluster is constrained
  to have close to population-level representation of each group. Despite significant
  attention, the salient issue of having incomplete knowledge about the group membership
  of each point has been superficially addressed. In this paper, we consider a setting
  where the assigned group memberships are noisy. We introduce a simple noise model
  that requires a small number of parameters to be given by the decision maker. We
  then present an algorithm for fair clustering with provable \\emph{robustness} guarantees.
  Our framework enables the decision maker to trade off between the robustness and
  the clustering quality. Unlike previous work, our algorithms are backed by worst-case
  theoretical guarantees. Finally, we empirically verify the performance of our algorithm
  on real world datasets and show its superior performance over existing baselines. "
