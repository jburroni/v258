abstract: " Understanding how neural networks transform input data across layers is
  fundamental to unraveling their learning and generalization capabilities. Although
  prior work has used insights from kernel methods to study neural networks, a global
  analysis of how the similarity between hidden representations evolves across layers
  remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for the
  evolution of the kernel sequence, which measures the similarity between the hidden
  representation for two different inputs. Operating under the mean-field regime,
  we show that the kernel sequence evolves deterministically via a kernel map, which
  only depends on the activation function. By expanding activation using Hermite polynomials
  and using their algebraic properties, we derive an explicit form for kernel map
  and fully characterize its fixed points. Our analysis reveals that for nonlinear
  activations, the kernel sequence converges globally to a unique fixed point, which
  can correspond to orthogonal or similar representations depending on the activation
  and network architecture. We further extend our results to networks with residual
  connections and normalization layers, demonstrating similar convergence behaviors.
  This work provides new insights into the implicit biases of deep neural networks
  and how architectural choices influence the evolution of representations across
  layers. "
