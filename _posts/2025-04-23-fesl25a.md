abstract: " Diffusion models (DMs) as generative priors have recently shown great
  potential for denoising tasks but lack theoretical understanding with respect to
  their mean square error (MSE) optimality. This paper proposes a novel denoising
  strategy inspired by the structure of the MSE-optimal conditional mean estimator
  (CME). The resulting DM-based denoiser can be conveniently employed using a pre-trained
  DM, being particularly fast by truncating reverse diffusion steps and not requiring
  stochastic re-sampling. We present a comprehensive (non-)asymptotic optimality analysis
  of the proposed diffusion-based denoiser, demonstrating polynomial-time convergence
  to the CME under mild conditions. Our analysis also derives a novel Lipschitz constant
  that depends solely on the DM’s hyperparameters. Further, we offer a new perspective
  on DMs, showing that they inherently combine an asymptotically optimal denoiser
  with a powerful generator, modifiable by switching re-sampling in the reverse process
  on or off. The theoretical findings are thoroughly validated with experiments based
  on various benchmark datasets. "
