title: 'Advancing Fairness in Precision Medicine: A Universal Framework for Optimal
  Treatment Estimation in Censored Data'
software: https://github.com/wangholly/FairHTEforCENSORED
openreview: fiKtvQN1Sj
abstract: 'In healthcare and precision medicine, estimating optimal treatment regimes
  for right-censored data while ensuring fairness across ethnic subgroups is crucial
  but remains underexplored. The problem presents two key challenges: measuring heterogeneous
  treatment effects (HTE) under fairness constraints and dealing with censoring mechanisms.
  We propose a general framework for estimating HTE using nonparametric methods and
  integrating user-controllable fairness constraints to address these problems. Under
  mild regularization assumptions, our method is theoretically grounded, demonstrating
  the double robustness property of the HTE estimator. Using this framework, we demonstrate
  that optimal treatment strategies balance fairness and utility. Using extensive
  simulations and real-world data analysis, we uncovered the potential of this method
  to guide the selection of treatment methods that are equitable and effective.'
