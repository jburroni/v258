title: 'Adversarial Training in High-Dimensional Regression: Generated Data and Neural
  Networks'
openreview: 8irxkKQZUD
abstract: 'In recent years, studies such as Carmon et al., (2019); Gowal et al., (2021)  demonstrate
  that incorporating additional real or generated data with pseudo-labels can enhance
  adversarial training through a two-stage training framework. In this paper, we perform
  a theoretical analysis of the asymptotic behavior of this method in high-dimensional
  regression problem when using two-layer neural networks. We first derive the asymptotics
  of the two-stage training framework using linear regression as a preliminary. Then,
  we analyze the convergence of two-layer neural networks in the two-stage framework.
  The analysis considers two different regimes: in the first stage of the framework,
  it is a high-dimensional regime, and in the second stage, the sample size is much
  larger than the data dimension. To analyze adversarial training, we track the change
  of the adversarial attack, and reveal that training with two-layer neural networks
  gives a prediction performance similar to training a linear model with some particular
  $\mathcal{L}_2$ regularization corresponding to different regimes. To highlight
  our technical contribution, we are the first to investigate adversarial training
  in two-layer neural networks under moderate attack strength, which is different
  from most existing literature in vanishing attack strength.'
