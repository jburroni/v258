abstract: " We derive the optimal differentially private additive noise mechanism
  for queries in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ when sensitivity and error are defined by an arbitrary
  norm $||\\cdot||_K$. The optimal mechanism is a generalization of the staircase
  mechanism, which is known to be optimal under the $\\ell_1$ norm when $d \\leq 2$;
  we extend the mechanism and its guarantee to arbitrary norms and dimensions, proving
  a conjecture of Geng et al. [2015] along the way. The generalized staircase mechanism
  we derive can be viewed as a refinement of the $K$-norm mechanism of Hardt and Talwar
  [2010] , with improvements particularly evident in the low-privacy regime as $\\epsilon
  \\to \\infty$. We show how to implement the generalized staircase mechanism efficiently,
  given an efficient algorithm for sampling the unit $K$-norm ball, and demonstrate
  that it significantly reduces error in realistic settings, including under non-standard
  norms that are common in practice, and across a range of error metrics. "
