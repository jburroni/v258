title: " Causal Temporal Regime Structure Learning "
software: " https://github.com/arahmani1/CASTOR "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=99oYWUq3yx "
abstract: " Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is essential
  for predicting and controlling dynamic systems in fields like economics, neuroscience,
  and climate science. However, existing causal discovery methods often assume stationarity,
  limiting their effectiveness when time series consist of sequential regimes, consecutive
  temporal segments with unknown boundaries and changing causal structures. In this
  work, we firstly introduce a framework to describe and model such time series. Then,
  we present CASTOR, a novel method that concurrently learns the Directed Acyclic
  Graph (DAG) for each regime while determining the number of regimes and their sequential
  arrangement. CASTOR optimizes the data log-likelihood using an expectation-maximization
  algorithm, alternating between assigning regime indices (expectation step) and inferring
  causal relationships in each regime (maximization step). We establish the identifiability
  of the regimes and DAGs within our framework. Extensive experiments show that CASTOR
  consistently outperforms existing causal discovery models in detecting different
  regimes and learning their DAGs across various settings, including linear and nonlinear
  causal relationships, on both synthetic and real world datasets. "
