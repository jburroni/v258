abstract: 'Our paper builds on the recent trend of using neural networks trained with
  self-supervised or supervised learning to solve the Most Probable Explanation (MPE)
  task in discrete graphical models. At inference time, these networks take an evidence
  assignment as input and generate the most likely assignment for the remaining variables
  via a single forward pass. We address two key limitations of existing approaches:
  (1) the inability to fully exploit the graphical modelâ€™s structure and parameters,
  and (2) the suboptimal discretization of continuous neural network outputs. Our
  approach embeds model structure and parameters into a more expressive feature representation,
  significantly improving  performance. Existing methods rely on standard thresholding,
  which often yields suboptimal results due to the non-convexity of the loss function.
  We introduce two methods to overcome discretization challenges: (1) an external
  oracle-based approach that infers uncertain variables using additional evidence
  from confidently predicted ones, and (2) a technique that identifies and selects
  the highest-scoring discrete solutions near the continuous output. Experimental
  results on various probabilistic models demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability
  of our approach, highlighting its practical impact.'
