abstract: " Towards designing learned optimization algorithms that are usable beyond
  their training setting, we identify key principles that classical algorithms obey,
  but have up to now, not been used for Learning to Optimize (L2O). Following these
  principles, we provide a general design pipeline, taking into account data, architecture
  and learning strategy, and thereby enabling a synergy between classical optimization
  and L2O, resulting in a philosophy of Learning Optimization Algorithms. As a consequence
  our learned algorithms perform well far beyond problems from the training distribution.
  We demonstrate the success of these novel principles by designing a new learning-enhanced
  BFGS algorithm and provide numerical experiments evidencing its adaptation to many
  settings at test time. "
