title: " A Unifying Framework for Action-Conditional Self-Predictive Reinforcement
  Learning "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=5DypCUsMg4 "
abstract: " Learning a good representation is a crucial challenge for reinforcement
  learning (RL) agents. Self-predictive algorithms jointly learn a latent representation
  and dynamics model by bootstrapping from future latent representations (BYOL). Recent
  work has developed theoretical insights into these algorithms by studying a continuous-time
  ODE model in the case of a fixed policy (BYOL-$\\Pi$); this assumption is at odds
  with practical implementations, which explicitly condition their predictions on
  future actions. In this work, we take a step towards bridging the gap between theory
  and practice by analyzing an action-conditional self-predictive objective (BYOL-AC)
  using the ODE framework. Interestingly, we uncover that BYOL-$\\Pi$ and BYOL-AC
  are related through the lens of variance. We unify the study of these objectives
  through two complementary lenses; a model-based perspective, where each objective
  is related to low-rank approximation of certain dynamics, and a model-free perspective,
  which relates the objectives to modified value, Q-value, and Advantage functions.
  This mismatch with the true value functions leads to the empirical observation (in
  both linear and deep RL experiments) that BYOL-$\\Pi$ and BYOL-AC are either very
  similar in performance across many tasks or task-dependent. "
