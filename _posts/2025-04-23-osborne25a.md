abstract: " Random feature maps are used to decrease the computational cost of kernel
  machines in large-scale problems. The Mondrian kernel is one such example of a fast
  random feature approximation of the Laplace kernel, generated by a computationally
  efficient hierarchical random partition of the input space known as the Mondrian
  process. In this work, we study a variation of this random feature map by applying
  a uniform random rotation to the input space before running the Mondrian process
  to approximate a kernel that is invariant under rotations. We obtain a closed-form
  expression for the isotropic kernel that is approximated, as well as a uniform convergence
  rate of the uniformly rotated Mondrian kernel to this limit. To this end, we utilize
  techniques from the theory of stationary random tessellations in stochastic geometry
  and prove a new result on the geometry of the typical cell of the superposition
  of uniformly rotated Mondrian tessellations. Finally, we test the empirical performance
  of this random feature map on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating
  its improved performance over the Mondrian kernel on a dataset that is debiased
  from the standard coordinate axes. "
