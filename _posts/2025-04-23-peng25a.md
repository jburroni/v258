openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=T9fHiIiPF1 "
abstract: " This paper proposes a new approach to estimating the distribution of a
  response variable conditioned on factors. We model the conditional quantile function
  as a mixture (weighted sum) of basis quantile functions, with weights depending
  on these factors. The estimation problem is formulated as a convex optimization
  problem. The objective function is equivalent to the continuous ranked probability
  score (CRPS). This approach can be viewed as conducting quantile regressions for
  all confidence levels simultaneously while inherently avoiding quantile crossing.
  We use spline functions of factors as a primary example for the weight function.
  We prove an approximation property of the model. To address computational challenges,
  we propose a dimensionality reduction method using tensor decomposition and an alternating
  algorithm. Our approach offers flexibility, interpretability, tractability, and
  extendability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. "
