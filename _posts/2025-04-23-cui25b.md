title: 'A Theoretical Understanding of Chain-of-Thought: Coherent Reasoning and Error-Aware
  Demonstration'
openreview: Ou6Ud3nZfH
abstract: Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance
  in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While theoretical
  investigations have been conducted to understand CoT, the underlying transformer
  used in these studies isolates the CoT reasoning process into separated in-context
  learning steps (Stepwise ICL). In this work, we theoretically show that, compared
  to Stepwise ICL, the transformer gains better error correction ability and more
  accurate predictions if the reasoning from earlier steps (Coherent CoT) is integrated.
  Given that this coherent reasoning changes the behavior of the transformer, we further
  investigate the sensitivity of the transformer with Coherent CoT when the demonstration
  examples are corrupted at the inference stage. Our theoretical results indicate
  that the transformer is more sensitive to errors in intermediate reasoning steps
  than the final outcome. Building upon this observation, we propose an improvement
  on CoT by incorporating both correct and incorrect reasoning paths in the demonstration.  Our
  experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
