abstract: ' We consider fair resource allocation in sequential decision-making environments
  modeled as weakly coupled Markov decision processes, where resource constraints
  couple the action spaces of $N$ sub-Markov decision processes (sub-MDPs) that would
  otherwise operate independently. We adopt a fairness definition using the generalized
  Gini function instead of the traditional utilitarian (total-sum) objective. After
  introducing a general but computationally prohibitive solution scheme based on linear
  programming, we focus on the homogeneous case where all sub-MDPs are identical.
  For this case,  we show for the first time that the problem reduces to optimizing
  the utilitarian objective over the class of "permutation invariant" policies. This
  result is particularly useful as we can exploit efficient algorithms that optimizes
  the utilitarian objective such as Whittle index policies in restless bandits to
  solve the problem with this fairness objective. For more general settings, we introduce
  a count-proportion-based deep reinforcement learning approach. Finally, we validate
  our theoretical findings with comprehensive experiments, confirming the effectiveness
  of our proposed method in achieving fairness. '
