title: Amortized Probabilistic Conditioning for Optimization, Simulation and Inference
software: https://github.com/acerbilab/amortized-conditioning-engine/
openreview: 3kRGSyp309
abstract: Amortized meta-learning methods based on pre-training have propelled fields
  like natural language processing and vision. Transformer-based neural processes
  and their variants are leading models for probabilistic meta-learning with a tractable
  objective. Often trained on synthetic data, these models implicitly capture essential
  latent information in the data-generation process. However, existing methods do
  not allow users to flexibly inject (condition on) and extract (predict) this probabilistic
  latent information at runtime, which is key to many tasks. We introduce the Amortized
  Conditioning Engine (ACE), a new transformer-based meta-learning model that explicitly
  represents latent variables of interest. ACE affords conditioning on both observed
  data and interpretable latent variables, the inclusion of priors at runtime, and
  outputs predictive distributions for discrete and continuous data and latents.  We
  show ACEâ€™s practical utility  across diverse tasks such as image completion and
  classification, Bayesian optimization, and simulation-based inference, demonstrating
  how a general conditioning framework can replace task-specific solutions.
