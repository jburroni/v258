abstract: " The traditional two-stage approach to causal inference first identifies
  a \\emph{single} causal model (or equivalence class of models), which is then used
  to answer causal queries. However, this neglects any epistemic model uncertainty.
  In contrast, \\emph{Bayesian} causal inference does incorporate epistemic uncertainty
  into query estimates via Bayesian marginalisation (posterior averaging) over \\emph{all}
  causal models. While principled, this marginalisation over entire causal models,
  i.e., both causal structures (graphs) and mechanisms, poses a tremendous computational
  challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by decomposing structure marginalisation
  into the marginalisation over (i) causal orders and (ii) directed acyclic graphs
  (DAGs) given an order. We can marginalise the latter in closed form by limiting
  the number of parents per variable and utilising Gaussian Processes to model mechanisms.
  To marginalise over orders, we use a sampling-based approximation, for which we
  devise a novel auto-regressive distribution over causal orders (ARCO). Our method
  outperforms state-of-the-art in structure learning on simulated non-linear additive
  noise benchmarks, and yields competitive results on real-world data. Furthermore,
  we can accurately infer interventional distributions and average causal effects. "
