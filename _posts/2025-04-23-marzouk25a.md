title: On the Computational Tractability of the (Many) Shapley Values
openreview: xit2wOU09f
abstract: Recent studies have examined the computational complexity of computing Shapley
  additive explanations (also known as SHAP) across various models and distributions,
  revealing their tractability or intractability in different settings. However, these
  studies primarily focused on a specific variant called Conditional SHAP, though
  many other variants exist and address different limitations. In this work, we analyze
  the complexity of computing a much broader range of such variants, including Conditional,
  Interventional, and Baseline SHAP, while exploring both local and global computations.
  We show that both local and global Interventional and Baseline SHAP can be computed
  in polynomial time for various ML models under Hidden Markov Model distributions,
  extending popular algorithms such as TreeSHAP beyond empirical distributions. On
  the downside, we prove intractability results for these variants over a wide range
  of neural networks and tree ensembles. We believe that our results emphasize the
  intricate diversity of computing Shapley values, demonstrating how their complexity
  is substantially shaped by both the specific SHAP variant, the model type, and the
  distribution.
