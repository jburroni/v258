title: " Protein Fitness Landscape: Spectral Graph Theory Perspective "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=a4LNkhVEBg "
abstract: " In this work, we present a novel theoretical framework for analyzing and
  modeling protein fitness landscapes using spectral graph theory. By representing
  the protein sequence space as a generalized Hamming graph and studying its spectral
  properties, we derive a set of powerful tools for quantifying the ruggedness, epistasis,
  and other key characteristics of the landscape. We prove strong approximation and
  sampling results, showing that the landscape can be efficiently learned and optimized
  from limited and noisy data. Building on this foundation, we introduce Propagational
  Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNNs), a new class of inductive surrogate oracle.
  We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on the generalization and convergence
  properties of PCNNs, using techniques from the Neural Tangent Kernel framework.
  Extensive experiments on real-world protein engineering tasks demonstrate the superiority
  of PCNNs over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher fitness and better generalization
  from limited data. "
