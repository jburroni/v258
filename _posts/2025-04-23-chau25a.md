abstract: " We introduce credal two-sample testing, a new hypothesis testing framework
  for comparing credal sets—convex sets of probability measures where each element
  captures aleatoric uncertainty and the set itself represents epistemic uncertainty
  that arises from the modeller’s partial ignorance. Compared to classical two-sample
  tests, which focus on comparing precise distributions, the proposed framework provides
  a broader and more versatile set of hypotheses. This approach enables the direct
  integration of epistemic uncertainty, effectively addressing the challenges arising
  from partial ignorance in hypothesis testing. By generalising two-sample test to
  compare credal sets, our framework enables reasoning for equality, inclusion, intersection,
  and mutual exclusivity, each offering unique insights into the modeller’s epistemic
  beliefs. As the first work on nonparametric hypothesis testing for comparing credal
  sets, we focus on finitely generated credal sets derived from i.i.d. samples from
  multiple distributions—referred to as \\emph{credal samples}. We formalise these
  tests as two-sample tests with nuisance parameters and introduce the first permutation-based
  solution for this class of problems, significantly improving upon existing methods.
  Our approach properly incorporates the modeller’s epistemic uncertainty into hypothesis
  testing, leading to more robust and credible conclusions, with kernel-based implementations
  for real-world applications. "
