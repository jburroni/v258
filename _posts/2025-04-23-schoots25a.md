title: " Relating Piecewise Linear Kolmogorov Arnold Networks to ReLU Networks "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=6nmRoDYVpY "
abstract: " Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks are a new family of neural network architectures
  which holds promise for overcoming the curse of dimensionality and has interpretability
  benefits (Liu et al., 2024). In this paper, we explore the connection between Kolmogorov
  Arnold Networks (KANs) with piecewise linear (univariate real) functions and ReLU
  networks. We provide completely explicit constructions to convert a piecewise linear
  KAN into a ReLU network and vice versa. "
