title: Differentially private algorithms for linear queries via stochastic convex
  optimization
openreview: RX61IOwwxD
abstract: 'This article establishes a method to answer a finite set of linear queries
  on a given dataset while ensuring differential privacy. To achieve this, we formulate
  the corresponding task as a saddle-point problem, i.e. an optimization problem whose
  solution corresponds to a distribution minimizing the difference between answers
  to the linear queries based on the true distribution and answers from a differentially
  private distribution. Against this background, we establish two new algorithms for
  corresponding differentially private data release: the first is based on the differentially
  private Frank-Wolfe method, the second combines randomized smoothing with stochastic
  convex optimization techniques for a solution to the saddle-point problem. While
  previous works assess the accuracy of differentially private algorithms with reference
  to the empirical data distribution, a key contribution of our work is a more natural
  evaluation of the proposed algorithmsâ€™ accuracy with reference to the true data-generating
  distribution.'
