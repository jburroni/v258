title: 'ChronosX: Adapting Pretrained Time Series Models with Exogenous Variables'

abstract: Covariates provide valuable information on external factors that influence
  time series and are critical in many real-world time series forecasting tasks. For
  example, in retail, covariates may indicate promotions or peak dates such as holiday
  seasons that heavily influence demand forecasts. Recent advances in pretraining
  large language model architectures for time series forecasting have led to highly
  accurate forecasters. However, the majority of these models do not readily use covariates
  as they are often specific to a certain task or domain. This paper introduces a
  new method to incorporate covariates into pretrained time series forecasting models.
  Our proposed approach incorporates covariate information into pretrained forecasting
  models through modular blocks that inject past and future covariate information,
  without necessarily modifying the pretrained model in consideration. In order to
  evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark composed of 32 different synthetic
  datasets with varying dynamics to evaluate the effectivity of forecasting models
  with covariates. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show
  that our approach effectively incorporates covariate information into pretrained
  models, outperforming existing baselines.
