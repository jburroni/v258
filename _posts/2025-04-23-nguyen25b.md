  to Q-Learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search'

abstract: We study the problem of estimating the \emph{value} of the largest mean
  among $K$ distributions via samples from them (rather than estimating \emph{which}
  distribution has the largest mean), which arises from various machine learning tasks
  including Q-learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). While there have been a
  few proposed algorithms, their performance analyses have been limited to their biases
  rather than a precise error metric. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
  called HAVER (Head AVERaging) and analyze its mean squared error. Our analysis reveals
  that HAVER has a compelling performance in two respects. First, HAVER estimates
  the maximum mean as well as the oracle who knows the identity of the best distribution
  and reports its sample mean. Second, perhaps surprisingly, HAVER exhibits even better
  rates than this oracle when there are many distributions near the best one. Both
  of these improvements are the first of their kind in the literature, and we also
  prove that the naive algorithm that reports the largest empirical mean does not
  achieve these bounds.  Finally, we confirm our theoretical findings via numerical
  experiments where we implement HAVER in bandit, Q-learning, and MCTS algorithms.
  In these experiments, HAVER consistently outperforms the baseline methods, demonstrating
  its effectiveness across different applications.
