abstract: " Watermarking techniques embed statistical signals within content generated
  by large language models to help trace its source. Although existing methods perform
  well on long texts, their effectiveness significantly decreases for shorter texts.
  We introduce a statistical detection approach that improves the power of watermark
  detection, particularly in shorter texts. Our method leverages both the watermark
  key sequence and the next token probabilities (NTPs) to determine whether a text
  is generated by a large language model. We demonstrate the optimality of our approach
  and analyze its power properties. We also investigate an approach to estimating
  NTPs and extend our method to scenarios where texts face potential attacks such
  as substitutions, insertions, or deletions. We validate the effectiveness of our
  technique using texts generated by Meta-Llama-3-8B from Meta and Mistral-7B-v0.1
  from Mistral AI, utilizing prompts extracted from Googleâ€™s C4 dataset. In scenarios
  without attacks and with short text lengths, our method demonstrates approximately
  65% power improvement compared to the baseline method on average. We release all
  code publicly at \\url{https://github.com/doccstat/llm-watermark-adaptive.} "
