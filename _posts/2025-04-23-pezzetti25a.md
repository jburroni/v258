title: Function-Space MCMC for Bayesian Wide Neural Networks
openreview: Pgcc6fI0dw
abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks represent a fascinating confluence of deep learning
  and probabilistic reasoning, offering a compelling framework for understanding uncertainty
  in complex predictive models. In this paper, we investigate the use of the preconditioned
  Crank-Nicolson algorithm and its Langevin version to sample from a reparametrised
  posterior distribution of the neural networkâ€™s weights, as the widths grow larger.
  In addition to being robust in the infinite-dimensional setting, we prove that the
  acceptance probabilities of the proposed algorithms approach 1 as the width of the
  network increases, independently of any stepsize tuning. Moreover, we examine and
  compare how the mixing speeds of the underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, the preconditioned
  Crank-Nicolson and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin samplers are influenced
  by changes in the network width in some real-world cases. Our findings suggest that,
  in wide Bayesian Neural Networks configurations, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson
  algorithm allows for a scalable and more efficient sampling of the reparametrised
  posterior distribution, as also  evidenced by a higher effective sample size and
  improved diagnostic results compared with the other analysed algorithms.
