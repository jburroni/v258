title: Tighter Confidence Bounds for Sequential Kernel Regression
software: https://github.com/hamishflynn/KernelConfidenceBounds
openreview: DDeyFOIG1E
abstract: Confidence bounds are an essential tool for rigorously quantifying the uncertainty
  of predictions. They are a core component in many sequential learning and decision-making
  algorithms, with tighter confidence bounds giving rise to algorithms with better
  empirical performance and better performance guarantees. In this work, we use martingale
  tail inequalities to establish new confidence bounds for sequential kernel regression.
  Our confidence bounds can be computed by solving a conic program, although this
  bare version quickly becomes impractical, because the number of variables grows
  with the sample size. However, we show that the dual of this conic program allows
  us to efficiently compute tight confidence bounds. We prove that our new confidence
  bounds are always tighter than existing ones in this setting. We apply our confidence
  bounds to kernel bandit problems, and we find that when our confidence bounds replace
  existing ones, the KernelUCB (GP-UCB) algorithm has better empirical performance,
  a matching worst-case performance guarantee and comparable computational cost.
