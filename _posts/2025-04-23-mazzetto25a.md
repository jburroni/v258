abstract: " We introduce an adaptive method with formal quality guarantees for weak
  supervision in a non-stationary setting. Our goal is to infer the unknown labels
  of a sequence of data by using weak supervision sources that provide independent
  noisy signals of the correct classification for each data point. This setting includes
  crowdsourcing and programmatic weak supervision. We focus on the non-stationary
  case, where the accuracy of the weak supervision sources can drift over time, e.g.,
  because of changes in the underlying data distribution. Due to the drift, older
  data could provide misleading information to infer the label of the current data
  point. Previous work relied on a priori assumptions on the magnitude of the drift
  to decide how much data to use from the past. In contrast, our algorithm does not
  require any assumptions on the drift, and it adapts based on the input by dynamically
  varying its window size. In particular, at each step, our algorithm estimates the
  current accuracies of the weak supervision sources by identifying a window of past
  observations that guarantees a near-optimal minimization of the trade-off between
  the error due to the variance of the estimation and the error due to the drift.
  Experiments on synthetic and real-world labelers show that our approach adapts to
  the drift. "
