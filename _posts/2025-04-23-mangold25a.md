abstract: " In this paper, we present a novel analysis of $\\texttt{FedAvg}$ with
  constant step size, relying on the Markov property of the underlying process. We
  demonstrate that the global iterates of the algorithm converge to a stationary distribution
  and analyze its resulting bias and variance relative to the problemâ€™s solution.
  We provide a first-order bias expansion in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings.
  Interestingly, this bias decomposes into two distinct components: one that depends
  solely on stochastic gradient noise and another on client heterogeneity. Finally,
  we introduce a new algorithm based on the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique
  to mitigate this bias. "
