  Time Score Matching "
software: " https://github.com/Leyangw/tsm "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZAblNqZMU8 "
abstract: " This paper addresses differential inference in time-varying parametric
  probabilistic models, like graphical models with changing structures. Instead of
  estimating a high-dimensional model at each time and estimating changes later, we
  directly learn the differential parameter, i.e., the time derivative of the parameter.
  The main idea is treating the time score function of an exponential family model
  as a linear model of the differential parameter for direct estimation. We use time
  score matching to estimate parameter derivatives. We prove the consistency of a
  regularized score matching objective and demonstrate the finite-sample normality
  of a debiased estimator in high-dimensional settings. Our methodology effectively
  infers differential structures in high-dimensional graphical models, verified on
  simulated and real-world datasets. The code reproducing our experiments can be found
