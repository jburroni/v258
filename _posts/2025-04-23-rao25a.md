title: On Distributional Discrepancy for Experimental Design with General Assignment
  Probabilities
software: https://github.com/pengzhang91/MWU
openreview: hI7m3y9c4s
abstract: 'We investigate experimental design for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
  with both equal and unequal treatment-control assignment probabilities. Our work
  makes progress on the connection between the distributional discrepancy minimization
  (DDM) problem introduced by Harshaw et al. (2024) and the design of RCTs. We make
  two main contributions: First, we prove that approximating the optimal solution
  of the DDM problem within a certain constant error is NP-hard. Second, we introduce
  a new Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) algorithm for the DDM problem, which improves
  the Gram-Schmidt walk algorithm used by Harshaw et al. (2024) when assignment probabilities
  are unequal.  Building on the framework of Harshaw et al. (2024) and our MWU algorithm,
  we then develop the MWU design, which reduces the worst-case mean-squared error
  in estimating the average treatment effect. Finally, we present a comprehensive
  simulation study comparing our design with commonly used designs.'
