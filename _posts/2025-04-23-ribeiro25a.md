abstract: " Adversarial training can be used to learn models that are robust against
  perturbations. For linear models, it can be formulated as a convex optimization
  problem.  Compared to methods proposed in the context of deep learning, leveraging
  the optimization structure allows significantly faster convergence rates. Still,
  the use of generic convex solvers can be inefficient for large-scale problems. Here,
  we propose tailored optimization algorithms for the adversarial training of linear
  models, which render large-scale regression and classification problems more tractable.
  For regression problems, we propose a family of solvers based on iterative ridge
  regression and, for classification, a family of solvers based on projected gradient
  descent. The methods are based on extended variable reformulations of the original
  problem. We illustrate their efficiency in numerical examples. "
