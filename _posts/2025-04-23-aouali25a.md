title: Bayesian Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning for Large Action Spaces
software: https://github.com/imadaouali/bayes_opl
openreview: GB9na8s20p
abstract: In interactive systems, actions are often correlated, presenting an opportunity
  for more sample-efficient off-policy evaluation (OPE) and learning (OPL) in large
  action spaces. We introduce a unified Bayesian framework to capture these correlations
  through structured and informative priors. In this framework, we propose sDM, a
  generic Bayesian approach for OPE and OPL, grounded in both algorithmic and theoretical
  foundations. Notably, sDM leverages action correlations without compromising computational
  efficiency. Moreover, inspired by online Bayesian bandits, we introduce Bayesian
  metrics that assess the average performance of algorithms across multiple problem
  instances, deviating from the conventional worst-case assessments. We analyze sDM
  in OPE and OPL, highlighting the benefits of leveraging action correlations. Empirical
  evidence showcases the strong performance of sDM.
