title: Generalization Bounds for Dependent Data using Online-to-Batch Conversion.
openreview: MurWORTaF8
abstract: In this work, we give generalization bounds of statistical learning algorithms
  trained on samples drawn from a dependent data source both in expectation and with
  high probability, using the Online-to-Batch conversion paradigm. We show that the
  generalization error of statistical learners in the dependent data setting is equivalent
  to the generalization error of statistical learners in the i.i.d. setting up to
  a term that depends on the decay rate of the underlying mixing stochastic process,
  and is independent of the complexity of the statistical learner. Our proof techniques
  involve defining a new notion of stability of online learning algorithms based on
  Wasserstein distances, and employing ”near-martingale” concentration bounds for
  dependent random variables to arrive at appropriate upper bounds for the generalization
  error of statistical learners trained on dependent data. Finally, we prove that
  the Exponential Weighted Averages (EWA) algorithm satisfies our new notion of stability,
  and instantiate our bounds using the EWA algorithm.
