title: " Learning Identifiable Structures Helps Avoid Bias in DNN-based Supervised
  Causal Learning "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=8JwuE2HhY8 "
abstract: " Causal discovery is a structured prediction task that aims to predict
  causal relations among variables based on their data samples. Supervised Causal
  Learning (SCL) is an emerging paradigm in this field. Existing Deep Neural Network
  (DNN)-based methods commonly adopt the “Node-Edge approach”, in which the model
  first computes an embedding vector for each variable-node, then uses these variable-wise
  representations to concurrently and independently predict for each directed causal-edge.
  In this paper, we first show that this architecture has some systematic bias that
  cannot be mitigated regardless of model size and data size. We then propose SiCL,
  a DNN-based SCL method that predicts a skeleton matrix together with a v-tensor
  (a third-order tensor representing the v-structures). According to the Markov Equivalence
  Class (MEC) theory, both the skeleton and the v-structures are \\emph{identifiable}
  causal structures under the canonical MEC setting, so predictions about skeleton
  and v-structures do not suffer from the identifiability limit in causal discovery,
  thus SiCL can avoid the systematic bias in Node-Edge architecture, and enable consistent
  estimators for causal discovery. Moreover, SiCL is also equipped with a specially
  designed pairwise encoder module with a unidirectional attention layer to model
  both internal and external relationships of pairs of nodes. Experimental results
  on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that SiCL significantly outperforms
  other DNN-based SCL approaches. "
