abstract: " Modern high-energy physics (HEP) experiments are increasingly challenged
  by the vast size and complexity of their datasets, particularly regarding large-scale
  point cloud processing and long sequences. In this study, to address these challenges,
  we explore the application of structured state space models (SSMs), proposing one
  of the first trials to integrate local-sensitive hashing into either a hybrid or
  pure Mamba Model. Our results demonstrate that pure SSMs could serve as powerful
  backbones for HEP problems involving tasks for long sequence data with local inductive
  bias. By integrating locality-sensitive hashing into Mamba blocks, we achieve significant
  improvements over traditional backbones in key HEP tasks, surpassing them in inference
  speed and physics metrics while reducing computational overhead. In key tests, our
  approach demonstrated promising results, presenting a viable alternative to traditional
  transformer backbones by significantly reducing FLOPS while maintaining robust performance. "
