title: 'LC-Tsallis-INF: Generalized Best-of-Both-Worlds Linear Contextual Bandits'
openreview: JFDRlIELhm
abstract: We investigate the \emph{linear contextual bandit problem} with independent
  and identically distributed (i.i.d.) contexts. In this problem, we aim to develop
  a \emph{Best-of-Both-Worlds} (BoBW) algorithm with regret upper bounds in both stochastic
  and adversarial regimes. We develop an algorithm based on \emph{Follow-The-Regularized-Leader}
  (FTRL) with Tsallis entropy, referred to as the $\alpha$-\emph{Linear-Contextual
  (LC)-Tsallis-INF}. We show that its regret is at most $O(\log(T))$ in the stochastic
  regime under the assumption that the suboptimality gap is uniformly bounded from
  below, and at most $O(\sqrt{T})$ in the adversarial regime. Furthermore, our regret
  analysis is extended to more general regimes characterized by the \emph{margin condition}
  with a parameter $\beta \in (1, \infty]$, which imposes a milder assumption on the
  suboptimality gap than in previous studies. We show that the proposed algorithm
  achieves $O\left(\log(T)^{\frac{1+\beta}{2+\beta}}T^{\frac{1}{2+\beta}}\right)$
  regret under the margin condition.
