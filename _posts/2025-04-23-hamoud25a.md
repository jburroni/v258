title: 'Safety in the Face of Adversity: Achieving Zero Constraint Violation in Online
  Learning with Slowly Changing Constraints'
openreview: UEU6hsCWCC
abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation
  in Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic constraint
  changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow for occasional
  safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining strict safety under
  the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely the constraints change
  at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds. This is achieved through a
  primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in the dual space. We show that
  employing a dichotomous learning rate enables ensuring both safety, via zero constraint
  violation, and sublinear regret. Our framework marks a  departure from previous
  work by providing the first provable guarantees for maintaining absolute safety
  in the face of changing constraints in OCO.
