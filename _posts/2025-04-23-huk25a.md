title: 'Your copula is a classifier in disguise: classification-based copula density
  estimation'
software: https://github.com/Huk-David/Ratio-Copula
openreview: XnDGR5pIwy
abstract: We propose reinterpreting copula density estimation as a discriminative
  task. Under this novel estimation scheme, we train a classifier to distinguish samples
  from the joint density from those of the product of independent marginals, recovering
  the copula density in the process. We derive equivalences between well-known copula
  classes and classification problems naturally arising in our interpretation. Furthermore,
  we show our estimator achieves theoretical guarantees akin to maximum likelihood
  estimation. By identifying a connection with density ratio estimation, we benefit
  from the rich literature and models available for such problems. Empirically, we
  demonstrate the applicability of our approach by estimating copulas of real and
  high-dimensional datasets, outperforming competing copula estimators in density
  evaluation as well as sampling.
