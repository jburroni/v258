title: Causal Representation Learning from General Environments under Nonparametric
  Mixing

openreview: S8lfepB2fz
abstract: Causal representation learning aims to recover the latent causal variables
  and their causal relations, typically represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs),
  from low-level observations such as image pixels. A prevailing line of research
  exploits multiple environments, which assume how data distributions change, including
  single-node interventions, coupled interventions, or hard interventions, or parametric
  constraints on the mixing function or the latent causal model, such as linearity.
  Despite the novelty and elegance of the results, they are often violated in real
  problems. Accordingly, we formalize a set of desiderata for causal representation
  learning that applies to a broader class of environments, referred to as general
  environments. Interestingly, we show that one can fully recover the latent DAG and
  identify the latent variables up to minor indeterminacies under a nonparametric
  mixing function and nonlinear latent causal models, such as additive (Gaussian)
  noise models or heteroscedastic noise models, by properly leveraging sufficient
  change conditions on the causal mechanisms up to third-order derivatives. These
  represent, to our knowledge, the first results to fully recover the latent DAG from
  general environments under nonparametric mixing. Notably, our results are stronger
  than many existing works, but require less restrictive assumptions about changing
  environments.
