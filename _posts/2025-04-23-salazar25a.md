title: 'Posterior Mean Matching: Generative Modeling through Online Bayesian Inference'
openreview: GIqgx7iGpi
abstract: 'This paper introduces posterior mean matching (PMM), a new method for generative
  modeling that is grounded in Bayesian inference. PMM uses conjugate pairs of distributions
  to model complex data of various modalities like images and text, offering a flexible
  alternative to existing methods like diffusion models. PMM models iteratively refine
  noisy approximations of the target distribution using updates from online Bayesian
  inference. PMM is flexible because its mechanics are based on general Bayesian models.
  We demonstrate this flexibility by developing specialized examples: a generative
  PMM model of real-valued data using the Normal-Normal model, a generative PMM model
  of count data using a Gamma-Poisson model, and a generative PMM model of discrete
  data using a Dirichlet-Categorical model. For the Normal-Normal PMM model, we establish
  a direct connection to diffusion models by showing that its continuous-time formulation
  converges to a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Additionally, for the Gamma-Poisson
  PMM, we derive a novel SDE driven by a Cox process, which is a significant departure
  from traditional Brownian motion-based generative models.  PMMs achieve performance
  that is competitive with generative models for language modeling and image generation.'
