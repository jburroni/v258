title: To Give or Not to Give? The Impacts of Strategically Withheld Recourse
software: https://github.com/UCSC-REAL/Strategic-withheld-recourse
openreview: 0tOl3nmVGz
abstract: Individuals often aim to reverse undesired outcomes in interactions with
  automated systems, like loan denials, by either implementing system-recommended
  actions (recourse), or manipulating their features. While providing recourse benefits
  users and enhances system utility, it also provides information about the decision
  process that can be used for more effective strategic manipulation, especially when
  the individuals collectively share such information with each other. We show that
  this tension leads rational utility-maximizing systems to frequently withhold recourse,
  resulting in decreased population utility, particularly impacting sensitive groups.
  To mitigate these effects, we explore the role of recourse subsidies, finding them
  effective in increasing the provision of recourse actions by rational systems, as
  well as lowering the potential social cost and mitigating unfairness caused by recourse
  withholding.
