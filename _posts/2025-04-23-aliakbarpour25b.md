title: 'Privacy in Metalearning and Multitask Learning: Modeling and Separations'
openreview: JOkn8uueMg
abstract: Model personalization allows a set of individuals, each facing a different
  learning task, to train models that are more accurate for each person than those
  they could develop individually. The goals of personalization are captured in a
  variety of formal frameworks, such as multitask learning and metalearning. Combining
  data for model personalization poses risks for privacy because the output of an
  individualâ€™s model can depend on the data of other individuals.  In this work we
  undertake a systematic study of differentially private personalized learning. Our
  first main contribution is to construct a taxonomy of formal frameworks for private
  personalized learning. This taxonomy captures different formal frameworks for learning
  as well as different threat models for the attacker. Our second main contribution
  is to prove separations between the personalized learning problems corresponding
  to different choices.  In particular, we prove a novel separation between private
  multitask learning and private metalearning.
