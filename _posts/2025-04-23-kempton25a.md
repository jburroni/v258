title: 'TempTest: Local Normalization Distortion and the Detection of Machine-generated
  Text'
software: https://github.com/TMKempton/TempTest
openreview: tAoR5gUqeX
abstract: 'Existing methods for the zero-shot detection of machine-generated text
  are dominated by three statistical quantities: log-likelihood, log rank, and entropy.
  As language models mimic the distribution of human text ever closer, this will limit
  our ability to build effective detection algorithms. To combat this, we introduce
  a method for detecting machine-generated text that is entirely agnostic of the generating
  language model. This is achieved by targeting a defect in the way that decoding
  strategies, such as temperature or top-k sampling, normalize conditional probability
  measures. This method can be rigorously theoretically justified, is easily explainable,
  and is conceptually distinct from existing methods for detecting machine-generated
  text. We evaluate our detector in the white and black box settings across various
  language models, datasets, and passage lengths. We also study the effect of paraphrasing
  attacks on our detector and the extent to which it is biased against non-native
  speakers. In each of these settings, the performance of our test is at least comparable
  to that of other state-of-the-art text detectors, and in some cases, we strongly
  outperform these baselines.'
