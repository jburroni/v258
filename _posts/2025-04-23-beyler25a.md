abstract: ' In this paper, we derive variational inference upper-bounds on the log-partition
  function of a pairwize Markov random fields on the Boolean hypercube, based on quantum
  relaxations of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then propose an efficient algorithm
  to compute these bounds based on primal-dual optimization. An improvement of these
  bounds through the use of "hierarchies", similar to sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchies
  is proposed, and we present a greedy algorithm to select among these relaxations.
  We carry extensive numerical experiments and compare with state-of-the-art methods
  for this inference problem. '
