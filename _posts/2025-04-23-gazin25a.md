abstract: " In a split conformal framework with $K$ classes, a calibration sample
  of $n$ labeled examples is observed for inference on the label of a new unlabeled
  example. We explore the setting where a ’batch’ of $m$ independent such unlabeled
  examples is given, and the goal is to construct a batch prediction set with 1-$\\alpha$
  coverage. Unlike individual prediction sets, the batch prediction set is a collection
  of label vectors of size $m$, while the calibration sample consists of univariate
  labels.  A natural approach is to apply the Bonferroni correction, which concatenates
  individual prediction sets at level $1-\\alpha/m$.  We propose a uniformly more
  powerful solution, based on specific combinations of conformal $p$-values that exploit
  the Simes inequality. We provide a general recipe for valid inference with any combinations
  of conformal $p$-values, and compare the performance of several useful choices.
  \ Intuitively, the pooled evidence of relatively ‘easy’ examples within the batch
  can help provide narrower batch prediction sets. Additionally, we introduce a more
  computationally intensive method that aggregates batch scores and can be even more
  powerful.    The theoretical guarantees are established when all examples are independent
  and identically distributed (iid), as well as more generally when iid is assumed
  only conditionally within each class. Notably, our results remain valid under label
  distribution shift, since the distribution of the labels need not be the same in
  the calibration sample and in the new batch. The effectiveness of the methods is
  highlighted through illustrative synthetic and real data examples. "
