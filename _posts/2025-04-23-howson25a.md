title: " QuACK: A Multipurpose Queuing Algorithm for Cooperative $k$-Armed Bandits "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=H623AObRxU "
abstract: " This paper studies the cooperative stochastic $k$-armed bandit problem,
  where $m$ agents collaborate to identify the optimal action. Rather than adapting
  a specific single-agent algorithm, we propose a general-purpose black-box reduction
  that extends any single-agent algorithm to the multi-agent setting. Under mild assumptions,
  we prove that our black-box approach preserves the regret guarantees of the chosen
  algorithm, and is capable of achieving minimax-optimality up to an additive graph-dependent
  term. Our method applies to various bandit settings, including heavy-tailed and
  duelling bandits, and those with local differential privacy. Empirically, it is
  competitive with or outperforms specialized multi-agent algorithms. "
