  of relative error

abstract: Accurate heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation is essential for
  personalized recommendations, making it important to evaluate and compare HTE estimators.
  Traditional assessment methods are inapplicable due to missing counterfactuals.
  Current HTE evaluation methods rely on additional estimation or matching on test
  data, often ignoring the uncertainty introduced and potentially leading to incorrect
  conclusions. We propose incorporating uncertainty quantification into HTE estimator
  comparisons. In addition, we suggest shifting the focus to the estimation and inference
  of the relative error between methods rather than their absolute errors. Methodology-wise,
  we develop a relative error estimator based on the efficient influence function
  and establish its asymptotic distribution for inference. Compared to absolute error-based
  methods, the relative error estimator  (1) is less sensitive to the error of nuisance
  function estimators, satisfying a "global double robustness" property, and (2) its
  confidence intervals are often narrower, making it more powerful for determining
  the more accurate HTE estimator. Through extensive empirical study of the ACIC challenge
  benchmark datasets, we show that the relative error-based method more effectively
  identifies the better HTE estimator with statistical confidence, even with a moderately
  large test dataset or inaccurate nuisance estimators.
