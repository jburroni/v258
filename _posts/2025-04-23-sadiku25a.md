abstract: " We study the problem of finding optimal sparse, manifold-aligned counterfactual
  explanations for classifiers. Canonically, this can be formulated as an optimization
  problem with multiple non-convex components, including classifier loss functions
  and manifold alignment (or \\emph{plausibility}) metrics. The added complexity of
  enforcing \\emph{sparsity}, or shorter explanations, complicates the problem further.
  Existing methods often focus on specific models and plausibility measures, relying
  on convex $\\ell_1$ regularizers to enforce sparsity. In this paper, we tackle the
  canonical formulation using the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method, a simple
  yet efficient first-order procedure capable of handling smooth non-convex objectives
  and non-smooth $\\ell_p$ (where $0 \\leq p < 1$) regularizers. This enables our
  approach to seamlessly incorporate various classifiers and plausibility measures
  while producing sparser solutions. Our algorithm only requires differentiable data-manifold
  regularizers and supports box constraints for bounded feature ranges, ensuring the
  generated counterfactuals remain \\emph{actionable}. Finally, experiments on real-world
  datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively produces sparse, manifold-aligned
  counterfactual explanations while maintaining proximity to the factual data and
  computational efficiency. "
