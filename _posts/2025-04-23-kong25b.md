abstract: " Addressing real-world optimization problems becomes particularly challenging
  when analytic objective functions or constraints are unavailable. While numerous
  studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited research has focused
  on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given explicitly. Overlooking
  these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that are unrealistic in practice.
  To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose to perform optimization within
  the data manifold using diffusion models. To constrain the optimization process
  to the data manifold, we reformulate the original optimization problem as a sampling
  problem from the product of the Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective
  function and the data distribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on
  the differentiability of the objective function, we propose two different sampling
  methods. For differentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins
  with a guided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage
  for further correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative
  importance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal distribution.
  Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world black-box optimization
  datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization dataset show that our method
  achieves better or comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art baselines. "
