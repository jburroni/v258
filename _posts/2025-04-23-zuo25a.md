abstract: " This paper presents a post-processing algorithm for training fair neural
  network regression models that satisfy statistical parity, utilizing an explainable
  singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight matrix. We propose a linear transformation
  of the weight matrix, whereby the singular values derived from the SVD of the transformed
  matrix directly correspond to the differences in the first and second moments of
  the output distributions across two groups. Consequently, we can convert the fairness
  constraints into constraints on the singular values. We analytically solve the problem
  of finding the optimal weights under these constraints. Experimental validation
  on various datasets demonstrates that our method achieves a similar or superior
  fairness-accuracy trade-off compared to the baselines without using the sensitive
  attribute at the inference time. "
