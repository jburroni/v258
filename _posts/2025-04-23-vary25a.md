title: Black-Box Uniform Stability for Non-Euclidean Empirical Risk Minimization
openreview: 7xXqB7G8qA
abstract: We study first-order algorithms that are uniformly stable for empirical
  risk minimization (ERM) problems that are convex and smooth with respect to $p$-norms,
  $p \geq 1$. We propose a black-box reduction method that, by  employing properties
  of uniformly convex regularizers, turns an optimization algorithm for H{ö}lder smooth
  convex losses into a uniformly stable learning algorithm with optimal statistical
  risk bounds on the excess risk, up to a constant factor depending on $p$. Achieving
  a black-box reduction for uniform stability was posed as an open question by Attia
  and Koren (2022), which had solved the Euclidean case $p=2$. We explore applications
  that leverage non-Euclidean geometry in addressing binary classification problems.
