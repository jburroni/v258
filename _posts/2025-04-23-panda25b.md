title: " Local Stochastic Sensitivity Analysis For Dynamical Systems "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=52tHFOuGlg "
abstract: " We derive local sensitivities of statistical quantities of interest with
  respect to model parameters in dynamical systems. Our main contribution is the extension
  of adjoint-based a posteriori analysis for differential operators of generic dynamical
  systems acting on states to the Liouville operator acting on probability densities
  of the states. This results in theoretically rigorous estimates of sensitivity and
  error for a broad class of computed quantities of interest while propagating uncertainty
  through dynamical systems. We also derive Monte-Carlo type estimators to make these
  estimates computationally tractable using spatio-temporal normalizing flows and
  exploiting the hyperbolic nature of the Liouville equation.   Three examples demonstrate
  our method. First, for verification of the theoretical results, we use a 2D linear
  dynamical system with an initial multivariate Gaussian density.  Then, we apply
  our method to the challenging task of propagating uncertainty in a double attractor
  system to illustrate sensitivities in bimodal distributions.  Finally, we show that
  our method can provide sensitivities with respect to the parameters of Neural Ordinary
  Differential Equations (here, in the context of classification). "
