title: Understanding the Effect of GCN Convolutions in Regression Tasks
software: https://github.com/donnate/GNN_regression
openreview: bqKRG6Pn0t
abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have become a pivotal method in machine
  learning for modeling functions over graphs. Despite their widespread success across
  various applications, their statistical properties (e.g., consistency, convergence
  rates) remain ill-characterized. To begin addressing this knowledge gap, we consider
  networks for which the graph structure implies that neighboring nodes exhibit similar
  signals and provide statistical theory for the impact of convolution operators.
  Focusing on estimators based solely on neighborhood aggregation, we examine how
  two common convolutions—the original GCN and GraphSAGE convolutions—affect the learning
  error as a function of the neighborhood topology and the number of convolutional
  layers. We explicitly characterize the bias variance type trade-off incurred by
  GCNs as a function of the neighborhood size and identify specific graph topologies
  where convolution operators are less effective. Our theoretical findings are corroborated
  by synthetic experiments, and provide a start to a deeper quantitative understanding
  of convolutional effects in GCNs for offering rigorous guidelines for practitioners.
