title: Causal Discovery-Driven Change Point Detection in Time Series
software: https://github.com/CausalML-Lab/CausalCPD
openreview: 3tV5AtAXk0
abstract: 'Change point detection in time series aims to identify moments when the
  probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many areas,
  such as human activity sensing and medical science. In the context of multivariate
  time series, this typically involves examining the joint distribution of multiple
  variables: If the distribution of any one variable changes, the entire time series
  undergoes a distribution shift. However, in practical applications, we may be interested
  only in certain components of the time series, exploring abrupt changes in their
  distributions while accounting for the presence of other components. Here, assuming
  an underlying structural causal model that governs the time-series data generation,
  we address this task by proposing a two-stage non-parametric algorithm that first
  learns parts of the causal structure through constraint-based discovery methods,
  and then employs conditional relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify
  the change points. The conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution
  difference between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery
  method allows a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to independent
  and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the typical assumption
  of samples being IID in conventional change point detection methods can be relaxed
  based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through experiments on both synthetic and
  real-world datasets, we validate the correctness and utility of our approach.'
