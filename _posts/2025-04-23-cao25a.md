title: 'HR-Bandit: Human-AI Collaborated Linear Recourse Bandit'
software: https://github.com/ruijiang81/HR-Bandit
openreview: rJcXQnGbVb
abstract: 'Human doctors frequently recommend actionable recourses that allow patients
  to modify their conditions to access more effective treatments. Inspired by such
  healthcare scenarios, we propose the Recourse Linear UCB (\textsf{RLinUCB}) algorithm,
  which optimizes both action selection and feature modifications by balancing exploration
  and exploitation. We further extend this to the Human-AI Linear Recourse Bandit
  (\textsf{HR-Bandit}), which integrates human expertise to enhance performance. \textsf{HR-Bandit}
  offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee for improved initial performance,
  (ii) a human-effort guarantee to minimize required human interactions, and (iii)
  a robustness guarantee that ensures sublinear regret even when human decisions are
  suboptimal. Empirical results, including a healthcare case study, validate its superior
  performance against existing benchmarks.'
