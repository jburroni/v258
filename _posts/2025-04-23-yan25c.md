title: Understanding Expert Structures on Minimax Parameter Estimation in Contaminated
  Mixture of Experts
openreview: yMh0z4kTw8
abstract: 'We conduct the convergence analysis of parameter estimation in the contaminated
  mixture of experts. This model is motivated from the prompt learning problem where
  ones utilize prompts, which can be formulated as experts, to fine-tune a large-scale
  pre-trained model for learning downstream tasks. There are two fundamental challenges
  emerging from the analysis: (i) the proportion in the mixture of the pre-trained
  model and the prompt may converge to zero during the training, leading to the prompt
  vanishing issue; (ii) the algebraic interaction among parameters of the pre-trained
  model and the prompt can occur via some partial differential equations and decelerate
  the prompt learning. In response, we introduce a distinguishability condition to
  control the previous parameter interaction. Additionally, we also investigate various
  types of expert structure to understand their effects on the convergence behavior
  of parameter estimation. In each scenario, we provide comprehensive convergence
  rates of parameter estimation along with the corresponding minimax lower bounds.
  Finally, we run several numerical experiments to empirically justify our theoretical
  findings.'
