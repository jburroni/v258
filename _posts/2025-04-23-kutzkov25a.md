abstract: " Random walk based node embedding algorithms have attracted a lot of attention
  due to their scalability and ease of implementation. Previous research has focused
  on different walk strategies, optimization objectives, and embedding learning models.
  Inspired by observations on real data, we take a different approach and propose
  a new regularization technique. More precisely, the frequencies of node pairs generated
  by the skip-gram model on random walk node sequences follow a highly skewed distribution
  which causes learning to be dominated by a fraction of the pairs. We address the
  issue by designing an efficient sampling procedure that generates node pairs according
  to their smoothed frequency. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the
  advantages of our approach. "
