title: Locally Private Sampling with Public Data
software: https://github.com/bzamanlooy/LDP-Sampling-Public-data
openreview: Gka7Ob4Jjz
abstract: 'Local differential privacy (LDP) is increasingly employed in privacy-preserving
  machine learning to protect user data before sharing it with an untrusted aggregator.
  Most LDP methods   assume that users possess only a single data record, which is
  a significant limitation since users often gather extensive datasets (e.g., images,
  text, time-series data) and frequently have access to public datasets. To address
  this limitation, we propose a locally private sampling framework that leverages
  both the private and public datasets of each user. Specifically, we assume each
  user has two distributions: $p$ and $q$ that represent their private and public
  datasets, respectively. The objective is to design a mechanism that generates a
  private sample approximating $p$ while simultaneously preserving  $q$. We frame
  this objective as a minimax optimization problem using $f$-divergence as the utility
  measure. We fully characterize the minimax optimal mechanisms for general $f$-divergences
  provided that $p$ and $q$ are discrete distributions. Remarkably, we demonstrate
  that this optimal mechanism is universal across all $f$-divergences. Experiments
  validate the effectiveness of our minimax optimal mechanism compared to the state-of-the-art
  private sampler.'
