title: 'Faster WIND: Accelerating Iterative Best-of-$N$ Distillation  for LLM Alignment'
openreview: JOAAvVi1pf
abstract: Recent advances in aligning large language models with human preferences
  have corroborated the growing importance of best-of-$N$ distillation (BOND). However,
  the iterative BOND algorithm is prohibitively expensive in practice due to the sample
  and computation inefficiency. This paper addresses the problem by revealing a unified
  game-theoretic connection between iterative BOND and self-play alignment, which
  unifies seemingly disparate algorithmic paradigms. Based on the connection, we establish
  a novel framework, \textbf{WIN} rate \textbf{D}ominanceÂ (WIND), with a series of
  efficient algorithms for regularized win rate dominance optimization that approximates
  iterative BOND in the parameter space. We provides provable sample efficiency guarantee
  for one of the WIND variant with the square loss objective. The experimental results
  confirm that our algorithm not only accelerates the computation, but also achieves
  superior sample efficiency compared to existing methods.
