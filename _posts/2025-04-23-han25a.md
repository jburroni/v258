abstract: " Preference optimization has made significant progress recently, with numerous
  methods developed to align language models with human preferences. This paper introduces
  $f$-divergence Preference Optimization ($f$-PO), a novel framework that generalizes
  and extends existing approaches. $f$-PO minimizes $f$-divergences between the optimized
  policy and the optimal policy, encompassing a broad family of alignment methods
  using various divergences. Our approach unifies previous algorithms like DPO and
  EXO, while offering new variants through different choices of $f$-divergences. We
  provide theoretical analysis of $f$-PO’s properties and conduct extensive experiments
  on state-of-the-art language models using benchmark datasets. Results demonstrate
  $f$-PO’s effectiveness across various tasks, achieving superior performance compared
  to existing methods on popular benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench,
  and Open LLM Leaderboard v2. Additionally, we present ablation studies exploring
  the impact of different $f$-divergences, offering insights into the trade-offs between
  regularization and performance in offline preference optimization. Our work contributes
  both practical algorithms and theoretical understanding to the field of language
  model alignment. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/MinkaiXu/fPO.} "
