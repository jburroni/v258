abstract: ' Lifelong reinforcement learning (RL) has been developed as a paradigm
  for extending single-task RL to more realistic, dynamic settings. In lifelong RL,
  the "life" of an RL agent is modeled as a stream of tasks drawn from a task distribution.
  We propose EPIC (Empirical PAC-Bayes that Improves Continuously),  a novel algorithm
  designed for lifelong RL using PAC-Bayes theory. EPIC learns a shared policy distribution,
  referred to as the world policy, which enables rapid adaptation to new tasks while
  retaining valuable knowledge from previous experiences. Our theoretical analysis
  establishes a relationship between the algorithmâ€™s generalization performance and
  the number of prior tasks preserved in memory. We also derive the sample complexity
  of EPIC in terms of RL regret. Extensive experiments on a variety of environments
  demonstrate that EPIC significantly outperforms existing methods in lifelong RL,
  offering both theoretical guarantees and practical efficacy through the use of the
  world policy. '
