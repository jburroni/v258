title: Characterizing the Accuracy-Communication-Privacy Trade-off in Distributed
  Stochastic Convex Optimization
openreview: 9bB1FJSKKS
abstract: We consider the problem of differentially private stochastic convex optimization
  (DP-SCO) in a distributed setting with $M$ clients, where each of them has a local
  dataset of $N$ i.i.d. data samples from an underlying data distribution. The objective
  is to design an algorithm to minimize a convex population loss using a collaborative
  effort across $M$ clients, while ensuring the privacy of the local datasets. In
  this work, we investigate the accuracy-communication-privacy trade-off for this
  problem. We establish matching converse and achievability results using a novel
  lower bound and a new algorithm for distributed DP-SCO based on Vaidyaâ€™s plane cutting
  method. Thus, our results provide a complete characterization of the accuracy-communication-privacy
  trade-off for DP-SCO in the distributed setting.
