abstract: " Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are popular generative models used to sample
  from complex data distributions. Despite their empirical success in various machine
  learning tasks, significant gaps remain in understanding their theoretical properties,
  particularly regarding convergence guarantees. This paper aims to bridge that gap
  by providing non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for VAE trained using both Stochastic
  Gradient Descent and Adam algorithms. We derive a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log
  n / \\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of iterations of the optimization algorithm,
  with explicit dependencies on the batch size, the number of variational samples,
  and other key hyperparameters. Our theoretical analysis applies to both Linear VAE
  and Deep Gaussian VAE, as well as several VAE variants, including $\\beta$-VAE and
  IWAE. Additionally, we empirically illustrate the impact of hyperparameters on convergence,
  offering new insights into the theoretical understanding of VAE training. "
