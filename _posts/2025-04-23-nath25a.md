abstract: " Modern instances of combinatorial optimization problems often exhibit
  billion-scale ground sets, which have many uninformative or redundant elements.
  In this work, we develop light-weight pruning algorithms to quickly discard elements
  that are unlikely to be part of an optimal solution. Under mild assumptions on the
  instance, we prove theoretical guarantees on the fraction of the optimal value retained
  and the size of the resulting pruned ground set. Through extensive experiments on
  real-world datasets for various applications, we demonstrate that our algorithm,
  QuickPrune, efficiently prunes over 90% of the ground set and outperforms state-of-the-art
  classical and machine learning heuristics for pruning. "
