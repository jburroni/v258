title: " Learning Gaussian Multi-Index Models with Gradient Flow: Time Complexity
  and Directional Convergence "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=wYfOdkKnsr "
abstract: " This work focuses on the gradient flow dynamics of a neural network model
  that uses correlation loss to approximate a multi-index function on high-dimensional
  standard Gaussian data.  Specifically, the multi-index function we consider is a
  sum of neurons $f^*(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^k \\sigma^*(v_j^T x)$ where $v_1, ..., v_k$
  are unit vectors, and $\\sigma^*$ lacks the first and second Hermite polynomials
  in its Hermite expansion.  It is known that, for the single-index case ($k=1$),
  overcoming the search phase requires polynomial time complexity.  We first generalize
  this result to multi-index functions characterized by vectors in arbitrary directions.
  \ After the search phase, it is not clear whether the network neurons converge to
  the index vectors, or get stuck at a sub-optimal solution. When the index vectors
  are orthogonal, we give a complete characterization of the fixed points and prove
  that neurons converge to the nearest index vectors.  Therefore, using $n \\asymp
  k \\log k$ neurons ensures finding the full set of index vectors with gradient flow
  with high probability over random initialization. When $v_i^T v_j = \\beta \\geq
  0$ for all $i \\neq j$, we prove the existence of a sharp threshold $\\beta_c =
  c/(c+k)$ at which the fixed point that computes the average of the index vectors
  transitions from a saddle point to a minimum.  Numerical simulations show that using
  a correlation loss and a mild overparameterization suffices to learn all of the
  index vectors when they are nearly orthogonal, however, the correlation loss fails
  when the dot product between the index vectors exceeds a certain threshold. "
