abstract: " We consider a multi-armed bandit setting with finitely many arms, in which
  each arm yields an $M$-dimensional vector reward upon selection. We assume that
  the reward of each dimension (a.k.a. {\\em objective}) is generated independently
  of the others. The best arm of any given objective is the arm with the largest component
  of mean corresponding to the objective. The end goal is to identify the best arm
  of {\\em every} objective in the shortest (expected) time subject to an upper bound
  on the probability of error (i.e., fixed-confidence regime). We establish a problem-dependent
  lower bound on the limiting growth rate of the expected stopping time, in the limit
  of vanishing error probabilities. This lower bound, we show, is characterised by
  a max-min optimisation problem that is computationally expensive to solve at each
  time step. We propose an algorithm that uses the novel idea of {\\em surrogate proportions}
  to sample the arms at each time step, eliminating the need to solve the max-min
  optimisation problem at each step. We demonstrate theoretically that our algorithm
  is asymptotically optimal. In addition, we provide extensive empirical studies to
  substantiate the efficiency of our algorithm.  While existing works on pure exploration
  with multi-objective multi-armed bandits predominantly focus on {\\em Pareto front
  identification}, our work fills the gap in the literature by conducting a formal
  investigation of the multi-objective best arm identification problem. "
