title: " Signature Isolation Forest "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=oYqZvaMkmJ "
abstract: " Functional Isolation Forest (FIF) is a recent state-of-the-art Anomaly
  Detection (AD) algorithm designed for functional data. It relies on a tree partition
  procedure where an abnormality score is computed by projecting each curve observation
  on a drawn dictionary through a linear inner product. Such linear inner product
  and the dictionary are a priori choices that highly influence the algorithmâ€™s performances
  and might lead to unreliable results, particularly with complex datasets. This work
  aims to target such challenges by introducing Signature Isolation Forest, a novel
  class of AD algorithm leveraging the signature transform arising from rough path
  theory. Our objective is to remove the constraints imposed by FIF through the proposition
  of two algorithms which specifically target the linearity of the FIF inner product
  and the choice of the dictionary. We provide several numerical experiments, including
  a real-world applications benchmark showing the relevance of our methods. "
