title: Independent Learning in Performative Markov Potential Games
software: https://github.com/PauliusSasnauskas/performative-mpgs
openreview: b2YideB71N
abstract: Performative Reinforcement Learning (PRL) refers to a scenario in which
  the deployed policy changes the reward and transition dynamics of the underlying
  environment.  In this work, we study multi-agent PRL by incorporating performative
  effects into Markov Potential Games (MPGs). We introduce the notion of a performatively
  stable equilibrium (PSE) and show that it always exists under a reasonable sensitivity
  assumption. We then provide convergence results for state-of-the-art algorithms
  used to solve MPGs. Specifically, we show that independent policy gradient ascent
  (IPGA) and independent natural policy gradient (INPG) converge to an approximate
  PSE in the best-iterate sense, with an additional term that accounts for the performative
  effects. Furthermore, we show that INPG asymptotically converges to a PSE in the
  last-iterate sense. As the performative effects vanish, we recover the convergence
  rates from prior work. For a special case of our game, we provide finite-time last-iterate
  convergence results for a repeated retraining approach, in which agents independently
  optimize a surrogate objective. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our
  theoretical findings.
