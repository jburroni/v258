abstract: " N-glycosylation has many essential biological roles, and is important
  for biotherapeutics as it can affect drug efficacy, duration of effect, and toxicity.
  The prediction of N-glycosylation and other important biopharmaceutical production
  values have mostly been limited to mechanistic modeling. We present a residual hybrid
  modeling approach that integrates mechanistic modeling with machine learning to
  produce significantly more accurate predictions for N-glycosylation and bioproduction.
  For the largest dataset, the residual hybrid models have an average 736-fold reduction
  in testing prediction error. Furthermore, the residual hybrid models have lower
  prediction errors than the mechanistic models for all of the predicted variables
  in the datasets. We provide the automatic machine learning software used in this
  work, allowing reproduction and use of our software for other tasks. "
