title: AlleNoise - large-scale text classification benchmark dataset with real-world
  label noise
software: https://github.com/allegro/AlleNoise
openreview: Oq3ldAhvEC
abstract: Label noise remains a challenge for training robust classification models.
  Most methods for mitigating label noise have been benchmarked using primarily datasets
  with synthetic noise. While the need for datasets with realistic noise distribution
  has partially been addressed by web-scraped benchmarks such as WebVision and Clothing1M,
  those benchmarks are restricted to the computer vision domain. With the growing
  importance of Transformer-based models, it is crucial to establish text classification
  benchmarks for learning with noisy labels.  In this paper, we present AlleNoise,
  a new curated text classification dataset with real-world instance-dependent label
  noise, containing over 500,000 examples across approximately 5600 classes, complemented
  with a meaningful, hierarchical taxonomy of categories. The noise distribution comes
  from actual users of a major e-commerce marketplace, so it realistically reflects
  the semantics of human mistakes. In addition to the noisy labels, we provide human-verified
  clean labels, which help to get a deeper insight into the noise distribution, unlike
  web-scraped datasets typically used in the field. We demonstrate that a representative
  selection of established methods for learning with noisy labels is inadequate to
  handle such real-world noise. In addition, we show evidence that these algorithms
  do not alleviate excessive memorization. As such, with AlleNoise, we set a high
  bar for the development of label noise methods that can handle real-world label
  noise in text classification tasks. The code and dataset are available for download
