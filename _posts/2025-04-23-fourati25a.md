abstract: " Optimizing expensive, non-convex, black-box Lipschitz continuous functions
  presents significant challenges, particularly when the Lipschitz constant of the
  underlying function is unknown. Such problems often demand numerous function evaluations
  to approximate the global optimum, which can be prohibitive in terms of time, energy,
  or resources. In this work, we introduce Every Call is Precious (ECP), a novel global
  optimization algorithm that minimizes unpromising evaluations by strategically focusing
  on potentially optimal regions. Unlike previous approaches, ECP eliminates the need
  to estimate the Lipschitz constant, thereby avoiding additional function evaluations.
  ECP guarantees no-regret performance for infinite evaluation budgets and achieves
  minimax-optimal regret bounds within finite budgets. Extensive ablation studies
  validate the algorithm’s robustness, while empirical evaluations show that ECP outperforms
  10 benchmark algorithms—including Lipschitz, Bayesian, bandits, and evolutionary
  methods—across 30 multi-dimensional non-convex synthetic and real-world optimization
  problems, which positions ECP as a competitive approach for global optimization. "
