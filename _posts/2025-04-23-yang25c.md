abstract: " The diffusion bridge, which is a diffusion process conditioned on hitting
  a specific state within a finite period, has found broad applications in various
  scientific and engineering fields. However, simulating diffusion bridges for modeling
  natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term
  and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available
  to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain
  under explored. This paper presents a method that merges score-matching techniques
  with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to learn the infinite-dimensional
  bridge and achieving a discretization equivariant bridge simulation. We conduct
  a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions
  to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data. Our method
  demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution
  without extra training. "
