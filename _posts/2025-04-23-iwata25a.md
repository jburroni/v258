title: Meta-learning from Heterogeneous Tensors for Few-shot Tensor Completion
openreview: MvKNEaQMJT
abstract: We propose neural network-based models for tensor completion in few observation
  settings. The proposed model can meta-learn inductive bias from multiple heterogeneous
  tensors without shared modes. Although many tensor completion methods have been
  proposed, the existing methods cannot leverage knowledge across heterogeneous tensors,
  and their performance is low when only a small number of elements are observed.
  The proposed model encodes each element of a given tensor by considering information
  about other elements while reflecting the tensor structure via a self-attention
  mechanism. The missing values are predicted by tensor-specific linear projection
  from the encoded vectors. The proposed model is shared across different tensors,
  and it is meta-learned such that the expected tensor completion performance is improved
  using multiple tensors. By experiments using synthetic and real-world tensors, we
  demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing
  meta-learning and tensor completion methods.
