title: On adaptivity and minimax optimality of two-sided nearest neighbors
software: https://github.com/Tathagata-S/Two-Sided-NN
openreview: fThPOZ1GKW
abstract: 'Nearest neighbor (NN) algorithms have been extensively used for missing
  data problems in recommender systems and sequential decision-making systems. Prior
  theoretical analysis has established favorable guarantees for NN when the underlying
  data is sufficiently smooth and the missingness probabilities are lower bounded.
  Here we analyze NN with non-smooth non-linear functions with vast amounts of missingness.
  In particular, we consider matrix completion settings where the entries of the underlying
  matrix follow an latent non-linear factor model, with the non-linearity belonging
  to a H{ö}lder function class that is less smooth than Lipschitz. Our results establish
  following favorable properties for a suitable two-sided NN: (1) The mean squared
  error (MSE) of NN adapts to the smoothness of the non-linearity, (2) under certain
  regularity conditions, the NN error rate matches the rate obtained by an oracle
  equipped with the knowledge of both the row and column latent factors, and finally
  (3) NN’s MSE is non-trivial for a wide range of settings even when several matrix
  entries might be missing deterministically. We support our theoretical findings
  via extensive numerical simulations and a case study with data from a mobile health
  study, HeartSteps.'
