abstract: ' Modeling and analysis for event series generated by users of heterogeneous
  behavioral patterns are closely involved in our daily lives, including credit card
  fraud detection, online platform user recommendation, and social network analysis.  The
  most commonly adopted approach to this task is to assign users to behavior-based
  categories and analyze each of them separately. However, this requires extensive
  data to fully understand the user behavior, presenting challenges in modeling newcomers
  without significant historical knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel discrete
  event prediction framework for new users with limited history, without needing to
  know the userâ€™s category. We treat the user event history as the "treatment" for
  future events and the user category as the key confounder. Thus, the prediction
  problem can be framed as counterfactual outcome estimation, where each event is
  re-weighted by its inverse propensity score. We demonstrate the improved performance
  of the proposed framework with a numerical simulation study and two real-world applications,
  including Netflix rating prediction and seller contact prediction for customer support
  at Amazon. '
