abstract: " We propose a general method for constructing robust permutation tests
  under data corruption. The proposed tests effectively control the non-asymptotic
  type I error under data corruption, and we prove their consistency in power under
  minimal conditions. This contributes to the practical deployment of hypothesis tests
  for real-world applications with potential adversarial attacks. For the two-sample
  and independence settings, we show that our kernel robust tests are minimax optimal,
  in the sense that they are guaranteed to be non-asymptotically powerful against
  alternatives uniformly separated from the null in the kernel MMD and HSIC metrics
  at some optimal rate (tight with matching lower bound). We point out that existing
  differentially private tests can be adapted to be robust to data corruption, and
  we demonstrate in experiments that our proposed tests achieve much higher power
  than these private tests. Finally, we provide publicly available implementations
  and empirically illustrate the practicality of our robust tests. "
