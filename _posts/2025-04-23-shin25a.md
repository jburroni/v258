title: Dynamic DBSCAN with Euler Tour Sequences
software: https://github.com/seiyun-shin/dynamic_dbscan
openreview: Ot92gX5gpJ
abstract: We propose a fast and dynamic algorithm for Density-Based Spatial Clustering
  of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) that efficiently supports online updates. Traditional
  DBSCAN algorithms, designed for batch processing, become computationally expensive
  when applied to dynamic datasets, particularly in large-scale applications where
  data continuously evolves. To address this challenge, our algorithm leverages the
  Euler Tour Trees data structure, enabling dynamic clustering updates without the
  need to reprocess the entire dataset. This approach preserves a near-optimal accuracy
  in density estimation, as achieved by the state-of-the-art static DBSCAN method
  (Esfandiari et al., 2021).  Our method achieves an improved time complexity of $O(d
  \log^3(n) + \log^4(n))$ for every data point insertion and deletion, where $n$ and
  $d$ denote the total number of updates and the data dimension, respectively. Empirical
  studies also demonstrate significant speedups over conventional DBSCANs in real-time
  clustering of dynamic datasets, while maintaining comparable or superior clustering
  quality.
