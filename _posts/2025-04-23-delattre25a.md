title: Bridging the Theoretical Gap in Randomized Smoothing
software: https://github.com/blaisedelattre/bridging_the_gap_rs
openreview: AZ6T7HdCRt
abstract: Randomized smoothing has become a leading approach for certifying adversarial
  robustness in machine learning models. However, a persistent gap remains between
  theoretical certified robustness and empirical robustness accuracy. This paper introduces
  a new framework that bridges this gap by leveraging Lipschitz continuity for certification
  and proposing a novel, less conservative method for computing confidence intervals
  in randomized smoothing. Our approach tightens the bounds of certified robustness,
  offering a more accurate reflection of model robustness in practice. Through rigorous
  experimentation we show that our method improves the robust accuracy, compressing
  the gap between empirical findings and previous theoretical results. We argue that
  investigating local Lipschitz constants and designing ad-hoc confidence intervals
  can further enhance the performance of randomized smoothing. These results pave
  the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between Lipschitz continuity
  and certified robustness.
