title: Harnessing Causality in Reinforcement Learning with Bagged Decision Times
software: https://github.com/StatisticalReinforcementLearningLab/Bagged-Decision-Times
openreview: MdE3EIOyz0
abstract: We consider reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of problems with bagged
  decision times. A bag contains a finite sequence of consecutive decision times.
  The transition dynamics are non-Markovian and non-stationary within a bag. All actions
  within a bag jointly impact a single reward, observed at the end of the bag. For
  example, in mobile health, multiple activity suggestions in a day collectively affect
  a userâ€™s daily commitment to being active. Our goal is to develop an online RL algorithm
  to maximize the discounted sum of the bag-specific rewards. To handle non-Markovian
  transitions within a bag, we utilize an expert-provided causal directed acyclic
  graph (DAG). Based on the DAG, we construct states as a dynamical Bayesian sufficient
  statistic of the observed history, which results in Markov state transitions within
  and across bags. We then formulate this problem as a periodic Markov decision process
  (MDP) that allows non-stationarity within a period. An online RL algorithm based
  on Bellman equations for stationary MDPs is generalized to handle periodic MDPs.
  We show that our constructed state achieves the maximal optimal value function among
  all state constructions for a periodic MDP. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method
  on testbed variants built from real data in a mobile health clinical trial.
