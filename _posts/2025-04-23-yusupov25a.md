abstract: " In this paper, we propose a new geometric approach for knowledge graph
  completion  via low rank tensor approximation. We augment a pretrained and well-established
  Euclidean model based on a Tucker tensor decomposition with a novel hyperbolic interaction
  term. This correction enables more nuanced capturing of distributional properties
  in data better aligned with real-world knowledge graphs. By combining two geometries
  together, our approach improves expressivity of the resulting model achieving new
  state-of-the-art link prediction accuracy with a significantly lower number of parameters
  compared to the previous Euclidean and hyperbolic models. "
