abstract: " The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that
  comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation
  of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$
  is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm
  with running time $O(\\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation
  of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the
  sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use Inverse of  Convolutions in the
  forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling
  pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting
  in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing
  the inverse of convolution layer, resulting in fast training times also. We implement
  this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow
  models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved
  sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models. "
