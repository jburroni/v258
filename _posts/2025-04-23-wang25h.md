title: Statistical Learning of Distributionally Robust Stochastic Control in Continuous
  State Spaces
openreview: rOKQGZjwhq
abstract: 'We explore the control of stochastic systems with potentially continuous
  state and action spaces, characterized by the state dynamics $X_{t+1} = f(X_t, A_t,
  W_t)$. Here, $X$, $A$, and $W$ represent the state, action, and exogenous random
  noise processes, respectively, with $f$ denoting a known function that describes
  state transitions. Traditionally, the noise process $(W_t)_{t \geq 0}$ is assumed
  to be independent and identically distributed, with a distribution that is either
  fully known or can be consistently estimated. However, the occurrence of distributional
  shifts, typical in engineering settings, necessitates the consideration of the robustness
  of the policy. This paper introduces a distributionally robust stochastic control
  paradigm that accommodates possibly adaptive adversarial perturbation to the noise
  distribution within a prescribed ambiguity set. We examine two adversary models:
  current-action-aware and current-action-unaware, leading to different dynamic programming
  equations. Furthermore, we characterize the optimal finite sample minimax rates
  for achieving uniform learning of the robust value function across continuum states
  under both adversary types, considering ambiguity sets defined by $f_k$-divergence
  and Wasserstein distance. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework
  across various real-world settings.'
