title: Cross Validation for Correlated Data in Classification Models
software: https://github.com/OrenYuv/CVc-for-General-Models
openreview: zkTdiuQSnR
abstract: We present a methodology for model evaluation and selection in binary classification
  models with the presence of correlations in the data, where the sampling mechanism
  violates the i.i.d. assumption. Our methodology involves a formulation of the bias
  term between the standard Cross-Validation (CV) estimator and the mean generalization
  error, and practical data-based procedures to estimate this term. Consequently,
  we present the bias-corrected CV estimator, which is the standard CV estimate supplemented
  by an estimate of the bias term. This concept was introduced in the literature only
  in the context of a linear model with squared error loss as the criterion for prediction
  performance. Our suggested bias-corrected CV estimator can be applied to any learning
  model, including deep neural networks, and to standard criteria for prediction performance
  for classification tasks, including misclassification rate, cross-entropy and hinge
  loss. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology in various scenarios
  where the data contains complex correlation structures (such as clustered and spatial
  relationships) with synthetic data and real-world datasets, providing evidence that
  the bias-corrected CV estimator is better than the standard CV estimator.
