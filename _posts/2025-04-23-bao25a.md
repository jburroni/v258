title: " Inverse Optimization with Prediction Market: A Characterization of Scoring
  Rules for Elciting System States "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=sQwftWSlmI "
abstract: " Inverse optimization aims to recover the unknown state in forward optimization
  after observing a state-outcome pair. This is relevant when we want to identify
  the underlying state of a system or to design a system with desirable outcomes.
  Whereas inverse optimization has been investigated in the algorithmic perspective
  during past two decades, its formulation intimately tied with the principal’s subjective
  choice of a desirable state—indeed, this is crucial to make the inverse problem
  well-posed. We go beyond the conventional inverse optimization by building upon
  prediction market, where multiple agents submit their beliefs until converging to
  market equilibria. The market equilibria express the crowd consensus on a desirable
  state, effectively eschewing the subjective design. To this end, we derive a proper
  scoring rule for prediction market design in the context of inverse optimization. "
