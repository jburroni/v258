abstract: " Accurate forecasting of multivariate time series data is important in
  many engineering and scientific applications. Recent state-of-the-art works ignore
  the inter-relations between variates, using their model on each variate independently.
  This raises several research questions related to proper modeling of multivariate
  data. In this work, we propose to view multivariate forecasting as a multi-task
  learning problem, facilitating the analysis of forecasting by considering the angle
  between task gradients and their balance. To do so, we analyze linear models to
  characterize the behavior of tasks. Our analysis suggests that tasks can be defined
  by grouping similar variates together, which we achieve via a simple clustering
  that depends on correlation-based similarities. Moreover, to balance tasks, we scale
  gradients with respect to their prediction error. Then, each task is solved with
  a linear model within our MTLinear framework. We evaluate our approach on challenging
  benchmarks in comparison to strong baselines, and we show it obtains on-par or better
  results on multivariate forecasting problems. "
