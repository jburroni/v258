title: " Two-Timescale Linear Stochastic Approximation: Constant Stepsizes Go a Long
  Way "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=CUXfaqPDmY "
abstract: " Previous studies on two-timescale stochastic approximation (SA) mainly
  focused on bounding mean-squared errors under diminishing stepsize schemes. In this
  work, we investigate {\\it constant} stpesize schemes through the lens of Markov
  processes, proving that the iterates of both timescales converge to a unique joint
  stationary distribution in Wasserstein metric. We derive explicit geometric and
  non-asymptotic convergence rates, as well as the variance and bias introduced by
  constant stepsizes in the presence of Markovian noise. Specifically, with two constant
  stepsizes $\\alpha < \\beta$, we show that the biases scale linearly with both stepsizes
  as  $\\Theta(\\alpha)+\\Theta(\\beta)$ up to higher-order terms, while the variance
  of the slower iterate (resp., faster iterate) scales only with its own stepsize
  as $O(\\alpha)$ (resp., $O(\\beta)$). Unlike previous work, our results require
  no additional assumptions such as $\\beta^2 \\ll \\alpha$ nor extra dependence on
  dimensions. These fine-grained characterizations allow tail-averaging and extrapolation
  techniques to reduce variance and bias, improving mean-squared error bound to $O(\\beta^4
  + \\frac{1}{t})$ for both iterates. "
