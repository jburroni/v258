abstract: " Research in adversarial machine learning (AML) has shown that statistical
  models are vulnerable to maliciously altered data. However, despite advances in
  Bayesian machine learning models, most AML research remains concentrated on classical
  techniques. Therefore, we focus on extending the white-box model poisoning paradigm
  to attack generic Bayesian inference, highlighting its vulnerability in adversarial
  contexts. A suite of attacks are developed that allow an attacker to steer the Bayesian
  posterior toward a target distribution through the strategic deletion and replication
  of true observations, even when only sampling access to the posterior is available.
  Analytic properties of these algorithms are proven and their performance is empirically
  examined in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. With relatively little effort,
  the attacker is able to substantively alter the Bayesianâ€™s beliefs and, by accepting
  more risk, they can mold these beliefs to their will. By carefully constructing
  the adversarial posterior, surgical poisoning is achieved such that only targeted
  inferences are corrupted and others are minimally disturbed. "
