title: " Conformal Prediction Under Generalized Covariate Shift with Posterior Drift "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=JWLkJrtpKp "
abstract: " In many real applications of statistical learning, collecting sufficiently
  many training data is often expensive, time-consuming, or even unrealistic. In this
  case, a transfer learning approach, which aims to leverage knowledge from a related
  source domain to improve the learning performance in the target domain, is more
  beneficial. There have been many transfer learning methods developed under various
  distributional assumptions. In this article, we study a particular type of classification
  problem, called conformal prediction, under a new distributional assumption for
  transfer learning. Classifiers under the conformal prediction framework predict
  a set of plausible labels instead of one single label for each data instance, affording
  a more cautious and safer decision. We consider a generalization of the covariate
  shift with posterior drift setting for transfer learning. Under this setting, we
  propose a weighted conformal classifier that leverages both the source and target
  samples, with a coverage guarantee in the target domain. Theoretical studies demonstrate
  favorable asymptotic properties. Numerical studies further illustrate the usefulness
  of the proposed method. "
