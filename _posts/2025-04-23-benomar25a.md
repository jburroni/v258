title: " On Tradeoffs in Learning-Augmented Algorithms "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=dZCQCanOAg "
abstract: " The field of learning-augmented algorithms has gained significant attention
  in recent years. Using potentially inaccurate predictions, these algorithms must
  exhibit three key properties: consistency, robustness, and smoothness. In scenarios
  with stochastic predictions, a strong average-case performance is required. Typically,
  the design of such algorithms involves a natural tradeoff between consistency and
  robustness, and previous works aimed to achieve Pareto-optimal tradeoffs for specific
  problems. However, in some settings, this comes at the expense of smoothness. In
  this paper, we explore the tradeoffs between all the mentioned criteria and show
  how they can be balanced. "
