abstract: " Dimensionality reduction (DR) offers interpretable representations of
  complex high-dimensional data, and recent DR methods have leveraged hyperbolic geometry
  to obtain faithful low-dimensional embeddings of high-dimensional hierarchical relationships.
  However, existing methods are dependent on neighbor embedding, which frequently
  ruins the continuous nature of the hierarchical structures. This paper proposes
  hyperboloid Gaussian process latent variable models (hGP-LVMs) to embed high-dimensional
  hierarchical data while preserving the implicit continuity via nonparametric estimation.
  We adopt generative modeling using the GP, which provides effective hierarchical
  embedding and executes ill-posed hyperparameter tuning. This paper presents three
  variants of the proposed models that employ original point, sparse point, and Bayesian
  estimations, and we establish their learning algorithms by incorporating the Riemannian
  optimization and active approximation scheme of the GP-LVM. In addition, we employ
  the reparameterization trick for scalable learning of the latent variables in the
  Bayesian estimation method. The proposed hGP-LVMs were applied to several datasets,
  and the results demonstrate their ability to represent high-dimensional hierarchies
  in low-dimensional spaces. "
