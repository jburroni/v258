abstract: " Time series analysis of non-Euclidean data is highly challenging and crucial
  for many real-world applications. We address the problem of detecting multiple changes
  in time series within these complex data spaces. Hadamard spaces, which encompass
  important data spaces like positive semidefinite matrices, certain Wasserstein spaces,
  and hyperbolic spaces, provide the right general framework to address this complexity.
  We propose a computationally efficient two-step iterative optimization algorithm
  called HOP (Hadamard Optimal Partitioning) that detects changes in the sequence
  of so-called Fr{Ã©}chet means. Under mild conditions, the proposed method consistently
  estimates the change point locations. HOP is highly versatile, accommodating structural
  assumptions such as cyclic patterns and epidemic settings, making it unique in the
  literature. We validate its performance in synthetic and real-world scenarios, including
  applications in human gait analysis using EMG data with low SNR and behavioral analysis
  of animal motion. "
