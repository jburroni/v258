title: Primal-Dual Spectral Representation for Off-policy Evaluation

abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is one of the most fundamental problems in reinforcement
  learning (RL) to estimate the expected long-term payoff of a given target policy
  with \emph{only} experiences from another behavior policy that is potentially unknown.
  The distribution correction estimation (DICE) family of estimators have advanced
  the state of the art in OPE by breaking the \emph{curse of horizon}. However, the
  major bottleneck of applying DICE estimators lies in the difficulty of solving the
  saddle-point optimization involved, especially with neural network implementations.
  In this paper, we tackle this challenge by establishing a \emph{linear representation}
  of value function and stationary distribution correction ratio, \emph{i.e.}, primal
  and dual variables in the DICE framework, using the spectral decomposition of the
  transition operator. Such primal-dual representation not only bypasses the non-convex
  non-concave optimization in vanilla DICE, therefore enabling an computational efficient
  algorithm, but also paves the way for more efficient utilization of historical data.
  We highlight that our algorithm, \textbf{SpectralDICE}, is the first to leverage
  the linear representation of primal-dual variables that is both computation and
  sample efficient, the performance of which is supported by a rigorous theoretical
  sample complexity guarantee and a thorough empirical evaluation on various benchmarks.
