abstract: 'One of the most basic problems in reinforcement learning (RL) is policy
  evaluation: estimating the long-term return, i.e., value function, corresponding
  to a given fixed policy. The celebrated Temporal Difference (TD) learning algorithm
  addresses this problem, and recent work has investigated finite-time convergence
  guarantees for this algorithm and variants thereof. However, these guarantees hinge
  on the reward observations being always generated from a well-behaved (e.g., sub-Gaussian)
  true reward distribution. Motivated by harsh, real-world environments where such
  an idealistic assumption may no longer hold, we revisit the policy evaluation problem
  from the perspective of \emph{adversarial robustness}. In particular, we consider
  a Huber-contaminated reward model where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt each
  reward sample with a small probability $\epsilon$. Under this observation model,
  we first show that the adversary can cause the vanilla TD algorithm to converge
  to any arbitrary value function. We then develop a novel algorithm called \emph{Robust-TD}
  and prove that its finite-time guarantees match that of vanilla TD with linear function
  approximation up to a small $O(\epsilon)$ term that captures the effect of corruption.
  We complement this result with a minimax lower bound, revealing that such an additive
  corruption-induced term is unavoidable. To our knowledge, these results are the
  first of their kind in the context of adversarial robustness of stochastic approximation
  schemes driven by Markov noise. The key new technical tool that enables our results
  is an analysis of the Median-of-Means estimator with corrupted, time-correlated
  data that might be of independent interest to the literature on robust statistics.'
