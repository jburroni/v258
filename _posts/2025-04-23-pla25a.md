abstract: " We consider the problem of mean estimation under user-level local differential
  privacy, where $n$ users are contributing through their local pool of data samples.
  Previous work assume that the number of data samples is the same across users. In
  contrast, we consider a more general and realistic scenario where each user $u \\in
  [n]$ owns $m_u$ data samples drawn from some generative distribution $\\mu$; $m_u$
  being unknown to the statistician but drawn from a known distribution $M$ over $\\mathbb{N}$.
  Based on a distribution-aware mean estimation algorithm, we establish an $M$-dependent
  upper bounds on the worst-case risk over $\\mu$ for the task of mean estimation.
  We then derive a lower bound. The two bounds are asymptotically matching up to logarithmic
  factors and reduce to known bounds when $m_u = m$ for any user $u$. "
