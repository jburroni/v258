abstract: " We study a federated version of multi-objective optimization (MOO), where
  a single model is trained to optimize multiple objective functions. MOO has been
  extensively studied in the centralized setting but is less explored in federated
  or distributed settings. We propose FedCMOO, a novel communication-efficient federated
  multi-objective optimization (FMOO) algorithm that improves the error convergence
  performance of the model compared to existing approaches. Unlike prior works, the
  communication cost of FedCMOO does not scale with the number of objectives, as each
  client sends a single aggregated gradient, obtained using randomized SVD (singular
  value decomposition), to the central server. We provide a convergence analysis of
  the proposed method for smooth non-convex objective functions under milder assumptions
  than in prior work. In addition, we introduce a variant of FedCMOO that allows users
  to specify a preference over the objectives in terms of a desired ratio of the final
  objective values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority
  of our proposed method over baseline approaches. "
