abstract: " Bayesian optimisation requires fitting a Gaussian process model, which
  in turn requires specifying prior on the unknown black-box function—most of the
  theoretical literature assumes this prior is known. However, it is common to have
  more than one possible prior for a given black-box function, for example suggested
  by domain experts with differing opinions. In some cases, the type-II maximum likelihood
  estimator for selecting prior enjoys the consistency guarantee, but it does not
  universally apply to all types of priors. If the problem is stationary, one could
  rely on the Regret Balancing scheme to conduct the optimisation, but in the case
  of time-varying problems, such a scheme cannot be used.  To address this gap in
  existing research, we propose a novel algorithm, PE-GP-UCB, which is capable of
  solving time-varying Bayesian optimisation problems even without the exact knowledge
  of the function’s prior.  The algorithm relies on the fact that either the observed
  function values are consistent with some of the priors, in which case it is easy
  to reject the wrong priors, or the observations are consistent with all candidate
  priors, in which case it does not matter which prior our model relies on. We provide
  a regret bound on the proposed algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm
  on toy and real-world time-varying problems and show that it outperforms the maximum
  likelihood estimator, fully Bayesian treatment of unknown prior and Regret Balancing. "
