abstract: We investigate the training dynamics of deep classifiers by examining how
  hierarchical relationships between classes evolve during training. Through extensive
  experiments, we argue that the learning process in classification problems can be
  understood through the lens of label clustering. Specifically, we observe that networks
  tend to distinguish higher-level (hypernym) categories in the early stages of training,
  and learn more specific (hyponym) categories later. We introduce a novel framework
  to track the evolution of the feature manifold during training, revealing how the
  hierarchy of class relations emerges and refines across the network layers. Our
  analysis demonstrates that the learned representations closely align with the semantic
  structure of the dataset, providing a quantitative description of the clustering
  process. Notably, we show that in the hypernym label space, certain properties of
  neuronal collapse appear earlier than in the hyponym label space, helping to bridge
  the gap between the initial and terminal phases of learning. We believe our findings
  offer new insights into the mechanisms driving hierarchical learning in deep networks,
  paving the way for future advancements in understanding deep learning dynamics.
