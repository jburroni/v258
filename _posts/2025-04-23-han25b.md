abstract: " Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are susceptible to distribution shifts, creating
  vulnerability and security issues in critical domains. There is a pressing need
  to enhance the generalizability of GNNs on out-of-distribution (OOD) test data.
  Existing methods that target learning an invariant (feature, structure)-label mapping
  often depend on oversimplified assumptions about the data generation process, which
  do not adequately reflect the actual dynamics of distribution shifts in graphs.
  In this paper, we introduce a more realistic graph data generation model using Structural
  Causal Models (SCMs), allowing us to redefine distribution shifts by pinpointing
  their origins within the generation process. Building on this, we propose a casual
  decoupling framework, DeCaf, that independently learns unbiased feature-label and
  structure-label mappings. We provide a detailed theoretical framework that shows
  how our approach can effectively mitigate the impact of various distribution shifts.
  We evaluate DeCaf across both real-world and synthetic datasets that demonstrate
  different patterns of shifts, confirming its efficacy in enhancing the generalizability
  of GNNs. Our code is available at: \\url{https://github.com/hanxiaoxue114/DeCaf-GraphOOD.} "
