abstract: " Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) leverage a compositional structure to model
  non-stationary processes. DGPs typically rely on local inducing point approximations
  across intermediate GP layers. Recent advances in DGP inference have shown that
  incorporating global Fourier features from the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
  (RKHS) can enhance the DGPs’ capability to capture complex non-stationary patterns.
  This paper extends the use of these features to compositional GPs involving linear
  transformations. In particular, we introduce Ordinary Differential Equation(ODE)–based
  RKHS Fourier features that allow for adaptive amplitude and phase modulation through
  convolution operations. This convolutional formulation relates our work to recently
  proposed deep latent force models, a multi-layer structure designed for modelling
  nonlinear dynamical systems. By embedding these adjustable RKHS Fourier features
  within a doubly stochastic variational inference framework, our model exhibits improved
  predictive performance across various regression tasks. "
