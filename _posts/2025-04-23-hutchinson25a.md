abstract: " We study the problem of online convex optimization (OCO) under unknown
  linear constraints that are either static, or stochastically time-varying. For this
  problem, we introduce an algorithm that we term Optimistically Safe OCO (OSOCO)
  and show that it enjoys $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and no constraint violation.
  In the case of static linear constraints, this improves on the previous best known
  $\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret under the same assumptions. In the case of stochastic
  time-varying constraints, our work supplements existing results that show $O(\\sqrt{T})$
  regret and $O(\\sqrt{T})$ cumulative violation under more general convex constraints
  and a different set of assumptions. In addition to our theoretical guarantees, we
  also give numerical results that further validate the effectiveness of our approach. "
