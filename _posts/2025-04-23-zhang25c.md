title: 'AxlePro: Momentum-Accelerated Batched Training of Kernel Machines'
software: https://github.com/parthe/AxlePro
openreview: DEV7FwZrOt
abstract: In this paper we derive a novel iterative algorithm for learning kernel
  machines. Our algorithm, $\textsf{AxlePro}$, extends the $\textsf{EigenPro}$ family
  of algorithms via momentum-based acceleration. $\textsf{AxlePro}$ can be applied
  to train kernel machines with arbitrary positive semidefinite kernels.  We provide
  a convergence guarantee for the algorithm and demonstrate the speed-up of $\textsf{AxlePro}$
  over competing algorithms via numerical experiments.  Furthermore, we also derive
  a version of $\textsf{AxlePro}$ to train large kernel models over arbitrarily large
  datasets.
