abstract: " There has been much recent interest in designing neural networks (NNs)
  with relaxed equivariance, which interpolate between exact equivariance and full
  flexibility for consistent performance gains. In a separate line of work, structured
  parameter matrices with low displacement rank (LDR)—which permit fast function and
  gradient evaluation—have been used to create compact NNs, though primarily benefiting
  classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a framework
  based on symmetry-based structured matrices to build approximately equivariant NNs
  with fewer parameters. Our approach unifies the aforementioned areas using Group
  Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the modern notion of regular representations
  of finite groups. GMs allow the design of structured matrices similar to LDR matrices,
  which can generalize all the elementary operations of a CNN from cyclic groups to
  arbitrary finite groups. We show GMs can also generalize classical LDR theory to
  general discrete groups, enabling a natural formalism for approximate equivariance.
  We test GM-based architectures on various tasks with relaxed symmetry and find that
  our framework performs competitively with approximately equivariant NNs and other
  structured matrix-based methods, often with one to two orders of magnitude fewer
  parameters. "
