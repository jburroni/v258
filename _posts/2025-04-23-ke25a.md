abstract: " We consider an operator-based latent Markov representation of a stochastic
  nonlinear dynamical system, where the stochastic evolution of the latent state embedded
  in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is described with the corresponding transfer
  operator, and develop a spectral method to learn this representation based on the
  theory of stochastic realization. The embedding may be learned simultaneously using
  reproducing kernels, for example, constructed with feed-forward neural networks.
  We also address the generalization of sequential state-estimation (Kalman filtering)
  in stochastic nonlinear systems, and of operator-based eigen-mode decomposition
  of dynamics, for the representation. Several examples with synthetic and real-world
  data are shown to illustrate the empirical characteristics of our methods, and to
  investigate the performance of our model in sequential state-estimation and mode
  decomposition. "
