abstract: Additive models (AMs) have sparked a lot of interest in machine learning
  recently, allowing the incorporation of interpretable structures into a wide range
  of model classes. Many commonly used approaches to fit a wide variety of potentially
  complex additive models build on the idea of boosting additive models. While boosted
  additive models (BAMs) work well in practice, certain theoretical aspects are still
  poorly understood, including general convergence behavior and what optimization
  problem is being solved when accounting for the implicit regularizing nature of
  boosting. In this work, we study the solution paths of BAMs and establish connections
  with other approaches for certain classes of problems. Along these lines, we derive
  novel convergence results for BAMs, which yield crucial insights into the inner
  workings of the method. While our results generally provide reassuring theoretical
  evidence for the practical use of BAMs, they also uncover some "pathologies" of
  boosting for certain additive model classes concerning their convergence behavior
  that require caution in practice. We empirically validate our theoretical findings
  through several numerical experiments.
