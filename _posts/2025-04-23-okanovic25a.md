title: 'All models are wrong, some are useful: Model Selection with Limited Labels'
software: https://github.com/RobustML-Lab/model-selector
openreview: n8KLQe9HlN
abstract: We introduce MODEL SELECTOR, a framework for label-efficient selection of
  pretrained classifiers. Given a pool of unlabeled target data, MODEL SELECTOR samples
  a small subset of highly informative examples for labeling, in order to efficiently
  identify the best pretrained model for deployment on this target dataset. Through
  extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MODEL SELECTOR drastically reduces the
  need for labeled data while consistently picking the best or near-best performing
  model. Across 18 model collections on 16 different datasets, comprising over 1,500
  pretrained models, MODEL SELECTOR reduces the labeling cost by up to 94.15% to identify
  the best model compared to the cost of the strongest baseline. Our results further
  highlight the robustness of MODEL SELECTOR in model selection, as it reduces the
  labeling cost by up to 72.41% when selecting a near-best model, whose accuracy is
  only within 1% of the best model.
