title: " Approximate Global Convergence of Independent Learning in Multi-Agent Systems "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=kVWy8yIHs1 "
abstract: " Independent learning (IL) is a popular approach for achieving scalability
  in large-scale multi-agent systems, yet it typically lacks global convergence guarantees.
  In this paper, we study two representative algorithms—independent $Q$-learning and
  independent natural actor-critic—within both value-based and policy-based frameworks,
  and provide the first finite-sample analysis for approximate global convergence.
  Our results show that IL can achieve global convergence up to a fixed error arising
  from agent interdependence, which characterizes the fundamental limit of IL in achieving
  true global convergence. To establish these results, we develop a novel approach
  by constructing a separable Markov decision process (MDP) for convergence analysis
  and then bounding the gap caused by the model discrepancy between this separable
  MDP and the original one. Finally, we present numerical experiments using a synthetic
  MDP and an electric vehicle charging example to demonstrate our findings and the
  practical applicability of IL. "
