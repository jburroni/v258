title: Variational Adversarial Training Towards Policies with Improved Robustness

abstract: 'Reinforcement learning (RL), while being the benchmark for policy formulation,
  often struggles to deliver robust solutions across varying scenarios, leading to
  marked performance drops under environmental perturbations.Â Traditional adversarial
  training, based on a two-player max-min game, is known to bolster the robustness
  of RL agents, but it faces challenges: first, the complexity of the worst-case optimization
  problem may induce \emph{over-optimism}, and second, the choice of a specific set
  of potential adversaries might lead to \emph{over-pessimism} by considering implausible
  scenarios. In this work, we first observe that these two challenges do not balance
  out each other. Thus, we propose to apply variational optimization to optimize over
  the worst-case distribution of the adversary instead of a single worst-case adversary.
  Moreover, to counteract over-optimism, we train the RL agent to maximize the lower
  quantile of the cumulative rewards under worst-case adversary distribution. Our
  novel algorithm demonstrates a significant advancement over existing robust RL methods,
  corroborating the importance of the identified challenges and the effectiveness
  of our approach. To alleviate computational overhead associated with the proposed
  approach, we also propose a simplified version with lower computational burden and
  only minimal performance degradation. Extensive experiments validate that our approaches
  consistently yield policies with superior robustness.'
