abstract: " Long-term time series forecasting is essential in areas like finance and
  weather prediction. Besides traditional methods that operate in the time domain,
  many recent models transform time series data into the frequency domain to better
  capture complex patterns. However, these methods often use filtering techniques
  to remove certain frequency signals as noise, which may unintentionally discard
  important information and reduce prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose
  the Frequency Decomposition Mixture-of-Experts (FreqMoE) model, which dynamically
  decomposes time series data into frequency bands, each processed by a specialized
  expert. A gating mechanism adjusts the importance of each output of expert based
  on frequency characteristics, and the aggregated results are fed into a prediction
  module that iteratively refines the forecast using residual connections. Our experiments
  demonstrate that FreqMoE outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving the best
  performance on 51 out of 70 metrics across all tested datasets, while significantly
  reducing the number of required parameters to under 50k, providing notable efficiency
  advantages. Code is available at: \\url{https://github.com/sunbus100/FreqMoE-main} "
