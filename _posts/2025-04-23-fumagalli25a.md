title: Unifying Feature-Based Explanations with Functional ANOVA and Cooperative Game
  Theory
software: https://github.com/FFmgll/unifying_feature_based_explanations
openreview: tp3Aw6t0QF
abstract: 'Feature-based explanations, using perturbations or gradients, are a prevalent
  tool to understand decisions of black box machine learning models. Yet, differences
  between these methods still remain mostly unknown, which limits their applicability
  for practitioners. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for local and
  global feature-based explanations using two well-established concepts: functional
  ANOVA (fANOVA) from statistics, and the notion of value and interaction from cooperative
  game theory. We introduce three fANOVA decompositions that determine the influence
  of feature distributions, and use game-theoretic measures, such as the Shapley value
  and interactions, to specify the influence of higher-order interactions. Our framework
  combines these two dimensions to uncover similarities and differences between a
  wide range of explanation techniques for features and groups of features. We then
  empirically showcase the usefulness of our framework on synthetic and real-world
  datasets.'
