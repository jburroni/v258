abstract: We consider synthesis and analysis of probability measures using the entropy-regularized
  Wasserstein-2 cost and its unbiased version, the Sinkhorn divergence. The synthesis
  problem consists of computing the barycenter, with respect to these costs, of reference
  measures given a set of coefficients belonging to the simplex. The analysis problem
  consists of finding the coefficients for the closest barycenter in the Wasserstein-2
  distance to a given measure. Under the weakest assumptions on the measures thus
  far in the literature, we compute the derivative of the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2
  cost.  We leverage this to establish a characterization of barycenters with respect
  to the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost as solutions that correspond to a
  fixed point of an average of the entropy-regularized displacement maps.  This characterization
  yields a finite-dimensional, convex, quadratic program for solving the analysis
  problem when the measure being analyzed is a barycenter with respect to the entropy-regularized
  Wasserstein-2 cost. We show that these coefficients, as well as the value of the
  barycenter functional, can be estimated from samples with dimension-independent
  rates of convergence, and that barycentric coefficients are stable with respect
  to perturbations in the Wasserstein-2 metric. We employ the barycentric coefficients
  as features for classification of corrupted point cloud data, and show that compared
  to neural network baselines, our approach is more efficient in small training data
  regimes.
