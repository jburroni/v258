abstract: " Simultaneously addressing multiple objectives is becoming increasingly
  important in modern machine learning. At the same time, data is often high-dimensional
  and costly to label. For a single objective such as prediction risk, conventional
  regularization techniques are known to improve generalization when the data exhibits
  low-dimensional structure like sparsity. However, it is largely unexplored how to
  leverage this structure in the context of multi-objective learning (MOL) with multiple
  competing objectives.  In this work, we discuss how the application of vanilla regularization
  approaches can fail, and propose a two-stage MOL framework that can successfully
  leverage low-dimensional structure.  We demonstrate its effectiveness experimentally
  for multi-distribution learning and fairness-risk trade-offs. "
