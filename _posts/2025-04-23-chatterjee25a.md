abstract: 'We consider the offline changepoint estimation problem in the context of
  multilayer stochastic block models. We develop an algorithm involving suitably chosen
  CUSUM statistics based on the adjacency matrices of the observed networks for estimating
  a single changepoint present in the input data. We provide rigorous theoretical
  guarantees on the performance of the proposed method when one or more of the following
  phenomena occur at the changepoint: (a) merging of communities, (b) splitting of
  communities, and (c) changes in the connection probabilities among the communities.
  We derive a lower bound on the minimax detectability threshold involving the relevant
  signal strength parameter and show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the
  changepoint consistently when the signal strength is above a small multiplicative
  factor times the minimax detectability threshold. We do not make any a priori assumption
  on the sparsity of the underlying networks and only require that the overall average
  degree goes to infinity. Via simulation experiments, we empirically show that the
  proposed algorithm works in regimes of signal strength where global network changepoint
  estimation algorithms that do not take into account the community structure, fail
  to estimate an existing changepoint correctly. Finally, we apply our algorithm to
  a series of networks constructed using roll call data from the US senate and obtain
  changepoint(s) which align with those reported in the political science literature
  regarding the phenomenon of increasing political polarization.'
