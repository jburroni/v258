title: Graph Machine Learning based Doubly Robust Estimator for Network Causal Effects
software: https://github.com/BaharanKh/GDML
openreview: Xr5YpYx8mo
abstract: Estimating causal effects in social network data presents unique challenges
  due to the presence of spillover effects and network-induced confounding. While
  much of the existing literature addresses causal inference in social networks, many
  methods rely on strong assumptions about the form of network-induced confounding.
  These assumptions often fail to hold in high-dimensional networks, limiting the
  applicability of such approaches. To address this, we propose a novel methodology
  that integrates graph machine learning techniques with the double machine learning
  framework, facilitating accurate and efficient estimation of both direct and peer
  effects in a single observational social network. Our estimator achieves semiparametric
  efficiency under mild regularity conditions, enabling consistent uncertainty quantification.
  Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and scalability
  of our method. Finally, we apply the proposed approach to examine the impact of
  Self-Help Group participation on financial risk tolerance, highlighting its practical
  relevance.
