title: Learning the Distribution Map in Reverse Causal Performative Prediction
software: https://github.com/dbracale/LearningDistributionPP-Code
openreview: rVEVn0MaVF
abstract: In numerous predictive scenarios, the predictive model affects the sampling
  distribution; for example, job applicants often meticulously craft their resumes
  to navigate through a screening system. Such shifts in distribution are particularly
  prevalent in social computing, yet, the strategies to learn these shifts from data
  remain remarkably limited. Inspired by a microeconomic model that adeptly characterizes
  agents’ behavior within labor markets, we introduce a novel approach to learning
  the distribution shift. Our method is predicated on a \emph{reverse causal model},
  wherein the predictive model instigates a distribution shift exclusively through
  a finite set of agents’ actions. Within this framework, we employ a microfoundation
  model for the agents’ actions and develop a statistically justified methodology
  to learn the distribution shift map, which we demonstrate to effectively minimize
  the performative prediction risk.
