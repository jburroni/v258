title: 'Accuracy on the wrong line: On the pitfalls of noisy data for out-of-distribution
  generalisation'
openreview: dwyKBQmOjR
abstract: Accuracy-on-the-line is a widely observed phenomenon in machine learning,
  where a model’s accuracy on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data
  is positively correlated across different hyperparameters and data configurations.
  But when does this useful relationship break down? In this work, we explore its
  robustness. The key observation is that noisy data and the presence of nuisance
  features can be sufficient to shatter the Accuracy-on-the-line phenomenon. In these
  cases, ID and OOD accuracy can become negatively correlated, leading to "Accuracy-on-the-wrong-line".
  This phenomenon can also occur in the presence of spurious (shortcut) features,
  which tend to overshadow the more complex signal (core, non-spurious) features,
  resulting in a large nuisance feature space. Moreover, scaling to larger datasets
  does not mitigate this undesirable behaviour and may even exacerbate it. We formally
  prove a lower bound on OOD error in a linear classification model, characterising
  the conditions on the noise and nuisance features for a large OOD error. We finally
  demonstrate this phenomenon across both synthetic and real datasets with noisy data
  and nuisance features.
