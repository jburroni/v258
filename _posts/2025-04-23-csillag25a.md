abstract: " When a machine learning model is deployed, its predictions can alter its
  environment, as better informed agents strategize to suit their own interests. With
  such alterations in mind, existing approaches to uncertainty quantification break.
  In this work we propose a new framework, Strategic Conformal Prediction, which is
  capable of robust uncertainty quantification in such a setting. Strategic Conformal
  Prediction is backed by a series of theoretical guarantees spanning marginal coverage,
  training-conditional coverage, tightness and robustness to misspecification that
  hold in a distribution-free manner. Experimental analysis further validates our
  method, showing its remarkable effectiveness in face of arbitrary strategic alterations,
  whereas other methods break. "
