abstract: " Graphons are continuous models that represent the structure of graphs
  and allow the generation of graphs of varying sizes. We propose Scalable Implicit
  Graphon Learning (SIGL), a scalable method that combines implicit neural representations
  (INRs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate a graphon from observed graphs.
  Unlike existing methods, which face important limitations like fixed resolution
  and scalability issues, SIGL learns a continuous graphon at arbitrary resolutions.
  GNNs are used to determine the correct node ordering, improving graph alignment.
  Furthermore, we characterize the asymptotic consistency of our estimator, showing
  that more expressive INRs and GNNs lead to consistent estimators. We evaluate SIGL
  in synthetic and real-world graphs, showing that it outperforms existing methods
  and scales effectively to larger graphs, making it ideal for tasks like graph data
  augmentation. "
