abstract: " In this paper, we give an almost linear time and space algorithms to sample
  from an exponential mechanism with an $\\ell_1$-score function defined over an exponentially
  large non-convex set. As a direct result, on input an $n$ vertex $m$ edges graph
  $G$, we present the first $\\widetilde{O}(m)$ time and $O(m)$ space algorithms for
  differentially privately outputting an $n$ vertex $O(m)$ edges synthetic graph that
  approximates all the cuts and the spectrum of $G$. These are the first private algorithms
  for releasing synthetic graphs that nearly match this taskâ€™s time and space complexity
  in the non-private setting while achieving the same (or better) utility as the previous
  works in the more practical sparse regime. Additionally, our algorithms can be extended
  to private graph analysis under continual observation. "
