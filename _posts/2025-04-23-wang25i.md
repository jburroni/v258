abstract: Applications of large language models often involve the generation of free-form
  responses, in which case uncertainty quantification becomes challenging. This is
  due to the need to identify task-specific uncertainties (e.g., about the semantics)
  which appears difficult to define in general cases. This work addresses these challenges
  from a perspective of Bayesian decision theory, starting from the assumption that
  our utility is characterized by a similarity measure that compares a generated response
  with a hypothetical true response. We discuss how this assumption enables principled
  quantification of the modelâ€™s subjective uncertainty and its calibration. We further
  derive a measure for epistemic uncertainty, based on a missing data perspective
  and its characterization as an excess risk. The proposed methods can be applied
  to black-box language models. We illustrate the methods on question answering and
  machine translation tasks. Our experiments provide a principled evaluation of task-specific
  calibration, and demonstrate that epistemic uncertainty offers a promising deferral
  strategy for efficient data acquisition in in-context learning.
