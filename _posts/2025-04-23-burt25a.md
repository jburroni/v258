abstract: " Spatial prediction tasks are key to weather forecasting, studying air
  pollution impacts, and other scientific endeavors. Determining how much to trust
  predictions made by statistical or physical methods is essential for the credibility
  of scientific conclusions. Unfortunately, classical approaches for validation fail
  to handle mismatch between locations available for validation and (test) locations
  where we want to make predictions. This mismatch is often not an instance of covariate
  shift (as commonly formalized) because the validation and test locations are fixed
  (e.g., on a grid or at select points) rather than i.i.d. from two distributions.
  In the present work, we formalize a check on validation methods: that they become
  arbitrarily accurate as validation data becomes arbitrarily dense. We show that
  classical and covariate-shift methods can fail this check. We propose a method that
  builds from existing ideas in the covariate-shift literature, but adapts them to
  the validation data at hand. We prove that our proposal passes our check. And we
  demonstrate its advantages empirically on simulated and real data. "
