title: Kernel Single Proxy Control for Deterministic Confounding
openreview: XP7AUhVhhu
abstract: 'We consider the problem of causal effect estimation with an unobserved
  confounder, where we observe a single proxy variable that is associated with the
  confounder. Although it has been shown that the recovery of an average causal effect
  is impossible in general from a single proxy variable, we show that causal recovery
  is possible if the outcome is generated deterministically. This generalizes existing
  work on causal methods with a single proxy variable to the continuous treatment
  setting. We propose two kernel-based methods for this setting: the first based on
  the two-stage regression approach, and the second based on a maximum moment restriction
  approach. We prove that both approaches can consistently estimate the causal effect,
  and we empirically demonstrate that we can successfully recover the causal effect
  on challenging synthetic benchmarks.'
