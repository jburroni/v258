abstract: " Making treatment effect estimation actionable for personalized decision-making
  requires overcoming the costs and delays of acquiring necessary features. While
  many machine learning models estimate Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE),
  they mostly assume that \\emph{all} relevant features are readily available at prediction
  time – a scenario that is rarely realistic. In practice, acquiring features, such
  as medical tests, can be both expensive and time-consuming, highlighting the need
  for strategies that select the most informative features for each individual, enhancing
  decision accuracy while controlling costs. Existing active feature acquisition (AFA)
  methods, developed for supervised learning, fail to address the unique challenges
  of CATE, such as confounding, overlap, and the structural similarities of potential
  outcomes under different treatments. To tackle these challenges, we propose specialised
  feature acquisition metrics and estimation strategies tailored to the CATE setting.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on synthetic
  datasets designed to reflect common biases and data issues. In doing so, this work
  aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge CATE estimation techniques and their
  practical, cost-efficient application in personalised treatment assignment. "
