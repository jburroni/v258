abstract: " Score-based generative modeling with probability flow ordinary differential
  equations (ODEs) has achieved remarkable success in a variety of applications. While
  various fast ODE-based samplers have been proposed in the literature and employed
  in practice, the theoretical understandings about convergence properties of the
  probability flow ODE are still quite limited. In this paper, we provide the first
  non-asymptotic convergence analysis for a general class of probability flow ODE
  samplers in 2-Wasserstein distance, assuming accurate score estimates and smooth
  log-concave data distributions. We then consider various examples and establish
  results on the iteration complexity of the corresponding ODE-based samplers. Our
  proof technique relies on spelling out explicitly the contraction rate for the continuous-time
  ODE and analyzing the discretization and score-matching errors by using synchronous
  coupling; the challenge in our analysis mainly arises from the inherent non-autonomy
  of the probability flow ODE and the specific exponential integrator that we study. "
