title: " Zero-Shot Action Generalization with Limited Observations "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=38atnV3R2h "
abstract: " Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving
  sequential decision-making problems. However, in real-world scenarios, RL agents
  often struggle to generalize when faced with unseen actions that were not encountered
  during training. Some previous works on zero-shot action generalization rely on
  large datasets of action observations to capture the behaviors of new actions, making
  them impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel
  zero-shot framework, Action Generalization from Limited Observations (AGLO). Our
  framework has two main components: an action representation learning module and
  a policy learning module. The action representation learning module extracts discriminative
  embeddings of actions from limited observations, while the policy learning module
  leverages the learned action representations, along with augmented synthetic action
  representations, to learn a policy capable of handling tasks with unseen actions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods for zero-shot action generalization across multiple benchmark
  tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in generalizing to new actions with minimal
  action observations. "
