title: " Learning the Pareto Front Using Bootstrapped Observation Samples "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=zoou4Qa6lu "
abstract: " We consider Pareto front identification (PFI) for linear bandits (PFILin),
  i.e., the goal is to identify a set of arms with undominated  mean reward vectors
  when the mean reward vector is a linear function of the context.  PFILin includes
  the best arm identification problem and multi-objective active learning as special
  cases.    The sample complexity of our proposed algorithm is optimal up to a logarithmic
  factor.    In addition, the regret incurred by our algorithm during the estimation
  is within a logarithmic factor of the optimal regret among all algorithms that identify
  the Pareto front. Our key contribution is a new estimator that in every round updates
  the estimate for the unknown parameter along \\emph{multiple} context directions
  – in contrast to the conventional estimator that only updates the parameter estimate
  along the chosen context.  This allows us to use low-regret arms to collect information
  about Pareto optimal arms.  Our key innovation is to reuse the exploration samples
  multiple times; in contrast to conventional estimators that use each sample only
  once.  Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully
  identifies the Pareto front while controlling the regret. "
