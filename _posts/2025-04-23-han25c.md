title: " Subspace Recovery in Winsorized PCA: Insights into Accuracy and Robustness "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZT4229EUU8 "
abstract: " In this paper, we explore the theoretical properties of subspace recovery
  using Winsorized Principal Component Analysis (WPCA), utilizing a common data transformation
  technique that caps extreme values to mitigate the impact of outliers. Despite the
  widespread use of winsorization in various tasks of multivariate analysis, its theoretical
  properties, particularly for subspace recovery, have received limited attention.
  We provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy of WPCA, showing that increasing
  the number of samples while decreasing the proportion of outliers guarantees the
  consistency of the sample subspaces from WPCA with respect to the true population
  subspace. Furthermore, we establish perturbation bounds that ensure the WPCA subspace
  obtained from contaminated data remains close to the subspace recovered from pure
  data. Additionally, we extend the classical notion of breakdown points to subspace-valued
  statistics and derive lower bounds for the breakdown points of WPCA. Our analysis
  demonstrates that WPCA exhibits strong robustness to outliers while maintaining
  consistency under mild assumptions. A toy example is provided to numerically illustrate
  the behavior of the upper bounds for perturbation bounds and breakdown points, emphasizing
  winsorizationâ€™s utility in subspace recovery. "
