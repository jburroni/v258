title: " Density Ratio Estimation via Sampling along Generalized Geodesics on Statistical
  Manifolds "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=v13muX4Q3i "
abstract: " The density ratio of two probability distributions is one of the fundamental
  tools in mathematical and computational statistics and machine learning, and it
  has a variety of known applications. Therefore, density ratio estimation from finite
  samples is a very important task, but it is known to be unstable when the distributions
  are distant from each other. One approach to address this problem is density ratio
  estimation using incremental mixtures of the two distributions. We geometrically
  reinterpret existing methods for density ratio estimation based on incremental mixtures.
  We show that these methods can be regarded as iterating on the Riemannian manifold
  along a particular curve between the two probability distributions. Making use of
  the geometry of the manifold, we propose to consider incremental density ratio estimation
  along generalized geodesics on this manifold. To achieve such a method requires
  Monte Carlo sampling along geodesics via transformations of the two distributions.
  We show how to implement an iterative algorithm to sample along these geodesics
  and show how changing the distances along the geodesic affect the variance and accuracy
  of the estimation of the density ratio. "
