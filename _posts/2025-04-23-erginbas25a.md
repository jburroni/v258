abstract: " We consider an assortment selection and pricing problem in which a seller
  has $N$ different items available for sale. In each round, the seller observes a
  $d$-dimensional contextual preference information vector for the user, and offers
  to the user an assortment of $K$ items at prices chosen by the seller. The user
  selects at most one of the products from the offered assortment according to a multinomial
  logit choice model whose parameters are unknown. The seller observes which, if any,
  item is chosen at the end of each round, with the goal of maximizing cumulative
  revenue over a selling horizon of length $T$. For this problem, we propose an algorithm
  that learns from user feedback and achieves a revenue regret of order $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d
  \\sqrt{K T} / L_0 )$ where $L_0$ is the minimum price sensitivity parameter. We
  also obtain a lower bound of order $\\Omega(d \\sqrt{T}/ L_0)$ for the regret achievable
  by any algorithm. "
