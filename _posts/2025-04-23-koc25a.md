title: 'Domain Adaptation and Entanglement: an Optimal Transport Perspective'

openreview: ZDyi1BeTu7
abstract: Current machine learning systems are brittle in the face of distribution
  shifts (DS), where the target distribution that the system is tested on differs
  from the source distribution used to train the system. This problem of robustness
  to DS has been studied extensively in the field of domain adaptation. For deep neural
  networks, popular methods for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) are domain matching
  methods that try to align the marginal distributions in the feature or output space.
  The current theoretical understanding of these methods, however, are limited and
  existing theoretical frameworks are not precise enough to characterize their performance
  in practice.  To this end, we derive new bounds based on optimal transport that
  analyze the UDA problem. Our new bound includes a term which we dub as entanglement,
  consisting of an expectation of Wasserstein distance between conditionals with respect
  to changing data distributions. Analysis of the entanglement term provides a novel
  perspective on the unoptimizable aspects of UDA. In various experiments with multiple
  models across several DS scenarios, we show that this term can be used to explain
  the varying performance of UDA algorithms.
