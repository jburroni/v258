title: " On Tractability of Learning Bayesian Networks with Ancestral Constraints "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=dTbfmEa8Vt "
abstract: " Expert knowledge can greatly reduce the complexity of Bayesian network
  structure learning by constraining the search space. These constraints can come
  in the form of ancestral constraints that relate to the existence of paths between
  nodes. When the constraints are compiled into a directed acyclic graph, the complexity
  of learning with ancestral constraints is connected to the number of ideals of the
  constraint graph. First, we consider precedence constraints which define a partial
  order that the structure must obey. Taking the path cover number of the constraint
  graph as a parameter, we extend earlier results to the problems of sampling and
  weighted counting of network structures. We also consider the problems with related
  ancestral constraints which state that a node must or cannot be an ancestor of another.
  With positive ancestral constraints, we show that the problems are tractable under
  the additional assumption that the constraint graph has only a small number of incomparable
  edges. On the other hand, the optimization problem is NP-hard with negative ancestral
  constraints when the path cover number is at least two. Finally, we show that these
  problems become fixed-parameter tractable if the constraints are compatible with
  a subclass of partial orders called bucket orders. "
