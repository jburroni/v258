abstract: " Local Differential Privacy (LDP) offers strong privacy guarantees without
  requiring users to trust external parties. However, LDP applies uniform protection
  to all data features, including less sensitive ones, which degrades performance
  of downstream tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Bayesian framework,
  Bayesian Coordinate Differential Privacy (BCDP), that enables feature-specific privacy
  quantification. This more nuanced approach complements LDP by adjusting privacy
  protection according to the sensitivity of each feature, enabling improved performance
  of downstream tasks without compromising privacy. We characterize the properties
  of BCDP and articulate its connections with  standard non-Bayesian privacy frameworks.
  We further apply our BCDP framework to the problems of private mean estimation and
  ordinary least-squares regression. The BCDP-based approach obtains improved accuracy
  compared to a purely LDP-based approach, without compromising on privacy. "
