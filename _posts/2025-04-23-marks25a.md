title: Pick-to-Learn and Self-Certified Gaussian Process Approximations
openreview: 1XTwh6x8ob
abstract: Generalisation bounds are crucial for providing data-driven models with
  performance and safety guarantees. In this respect, bounds that do not require a
  held-out test set are particularly valuable as they allow the use of all data for
  training. While many such bounds do not improve upon the train-test approach, which
  remains the gold standard, the P2L algorithm (Paccagnan et al., 2023) has shown
  great potential. However, P2L comes with limitations, including computational overhead,
  reliance on consistent data, and restriction to non-Bayesian settings. In this work,
  we overcome these challenges in general settings and employ the corresponding results
  to show that classical Gaussian process (GP) training procedures can be interpreted
  as instantiations of P2L, thus inheriting tight, self-certified bounds. Three contributions
  underpin these conclusions. First, we introduce early stopping in P2L, equipping
  it with a tight generalisation bound to reduce training costs and address the non-consistent
  case. Second, we adapt P2L to the Bayesian setting and demonstrate its equivalence
  to posterior updating in a hierarchical model. Third, we show that greedy subset-of-data
  GPs are special P2L instantiations. Numerical evidence shows that the resulting
  P2L bounds we obtain compare favourably with the train-test and PAC-Bayes approaches
  on various real-world datasets.
