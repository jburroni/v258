title: 'Learning in Herding Mean Field Games: Single-Loop Algorithm with Finite-Time
  Convergence Analysis'
openreview: Tb8fIVYrYb
abstract: We consider discrete-time stationary mean field games (MFG) with unknown
  dynamics and design algorithms for finding the equilibrium with finite-time complexity
  guarantees. Prior solutions to the problem assume either the contraction of a mean
  field optimality-consistency operator or strict weak monotonicity, which may be
  overly restrictive. In this work, we introduce a new class of solvable MFGs, named
  the "fully herding class", which expands the known solvable class of MFGs and for
  the first time includes problems with multiple equilibria. We propose a direct policy
  optimization method, Accelerated Single-loop Actor Critic Algorithm for Mean Field
  Games (ASAC-MFG), that provably finds a global equilibrium for MFGs within this
  class, under suitable access to a single trajectory of Markovian samples. Different
  from the prior methods, ASAC-MFG is single-loop and single-sample-path. We establish
  the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of ASAC-MFG to a mean field equilibrium
  via new techniques that we develop for multi-time-scale stochastic approximation.
  We support the theoretical results with illustrative numerical simulations. When
  the mean field does not affect the transition and reward, a MFG reduces to a Markov
  decision process (MDP) and ASAC-MFG becomes an actor-critic algorithm for finding
  the optimal policy in average-reward MDPs, with a sample complexity matching the
  state-of-the-art. Previous works derive the complexity assuming a contraction on
  the Bellman operator, which is invalid for average-reward MDPs. We match the rate
  while removing the untenable assumption through an improved Lyapunov function.
