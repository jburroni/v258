abstract: " Multiple two-sample test problem in a graph-structured setting is a common
  scenario in fields such as Spatial Statistics and Neuroscience. Each node $v$ in
  fixed graph deals with a two-sample testing problem between two node-specific probability
  density functions, $p_v$ and $q_v$. The goal is to identify nodes where the null
  hypothesis $p_v = q_v$ should be rejected, under the assumption that connected nodes
  would yield similar test outcomes. We propose the non-parametric collaborative two-sample
  testing (CTST) framework that efficiently leverages the graph structure and minimizes
  the assumptions over $p_v$ and $q_v$. CTST integrates elements from f-divergence
  estimation, Kernel Methods, and Multitask Learning. We use synthetic experiments
  and a real sensor network detecting seismic activity to demonstrate that CTST outperforms
  state-of-the-art non-parametric statistical tests that apply at each node independently,
  hence disregard the geometry of the problem. "
