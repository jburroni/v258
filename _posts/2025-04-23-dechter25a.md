abstract: " This paper focuses on the computational complexity of computing empirical
  plug-in estimates for causal effect queries. Given a causal graph and observational
  data, any identifiable causal query can be estimated from an expression over the
  observed variables, called the estimand. The estimand can then be evaluated by plugging
  in probabilities computed empirically from data.  In contrast to conventional wisdom
  which assumes that high dimensional probabilistic functions will lead to exponential
  evaluation time, we show that estimand evaluation can be done efficiently, potentially
  in time linear in the data size, depending on the estimand’s hypergraph. In particular,
  we show that both the $\\it{treewidth}$ and $\\it{hypertree width}$ of the estimand’s
  structure bound the evaluation complexity, analogous to their role in bounding the
  complexity of inference in probabilistic graphical models. In settings with high
  dimensional functions, the hypertree width often provides a more effective bound,
  since the empirical distributions are sparse. "
