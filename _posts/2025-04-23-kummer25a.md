abstract: " We investigate the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to bit-flip
  attacks (BFAs) by introducing an analytical framework to study the influence of
  architectural features, graph properties, and their interaction. The expressivity
  of GNNs refers to their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs and depends
  on the encoding of node neighborhoods. We examine the vulnerability of neural multiset
  functions commonly used for this purpose and establish formal criteria to characterize
  a GNNâ€™s susceptibility to losing expressivity due to BFAs. This enables an analysis
  of the impact of homophily, graph structural variety, feature encoding, and activation
  functions on GNN robustness. We derive theoretical bounds for the number of bit
  flips required to degrade GNN expressivity on a dataset, identifying ReLU-activated
  GNNs operating on highly homophilous graphs with low-dimensional or one-hot encoded
  features as particularly susceptible. Empirical results using ten real-world datasets
  confirm the statistical significance of our key theoretical insights and offer actionable
  results to mitigate BFA risks in expressivity-critical applications. "
