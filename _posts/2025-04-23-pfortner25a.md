abstract: " Kalman filtering and smoothing are the foundational mechanisms for efficient
  inference in Gauss-Markov models. However, their time and memory complexities scale
  prohibitively with the size of the state space. This is particularly problematic
  in spatiotemporal regression problems, where the state dimension scales with the
  number of spatial observations. Existing approximate frameworks leverage low-rank
  approximations of the covariance matrix. But since they do not model the error introduced
  by the computational approximation, their predictive uncertainty estimates can be
  overly optimistic. In this work, we propose a probabilistic numerical method for
  inference in high-dimensional Gauss-Markov models which mitigates these scaling
  issues. Our matrix-free iterative algorithm leverages GPU acceleration and crucially
  enables a tunable trade-off between computational cost and predictive uncertainty.
  Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method on a large-scale climate dataset. "
