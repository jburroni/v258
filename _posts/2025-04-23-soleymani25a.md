title: 'A Robust Kernel Statistical Test of Invariance: Detecting Subtle Asymmetries'
openreview: uPgGW67dSX
abstract: While invariances naturally arise in almost any type of real-world data,
  no efficient and robust test exists for detecting them in observational data under
  arbitrarily given group actions. We tackle this problem by studying measures of
  invariance that can capture even negligible underlying patterns. Our first contribution
  is to show that, while detecting subtle asymmetries is computationally intractable,
  a randomized method can be used to robustly estimate closeness measures to invariance
  within constant factors. This provides a general framework for robust statistical
  tests of invariance. Despite the extensive and well-established literature, our
  methodology, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to provide statistical tests
  for general group invariances with finite-sample guarantees on Type II errors. In
  addition, we focus on kernel methods and propose deterministic algorithms for robust
  testing with respect to both finite and infinite groups, accompanied by a rigorous
  analysis of their convergence rates and sample complexity. Finally, we revisit the
  general framework in the specific case of kernel methods, showing that recent closeness
  measures to invariance, defined via group averaging, are provably robust, leading
  to powerful randomized algorithms.
