title: 'Riemann$^2$: Learning Riemannian Submanifolds from Riemannian Data'
openreview: Ffb2Gt6p3U
abstract: Latent variable models are powerful tools for learning low-dimensional manifolds
  from high-dimensional data. However, when dealing with constrained data such as
  unit-norm vectors or symmetric positive-definite matrices, existing approaches ignore
  the underlying geometric constraints or fail to provide meaningful metrics in the
  latent space. To address these limitations, we propose to learn Riemannian latent
  representations of such geometric data. To do so, we estimate the pullback metric
  induced by a Wrapped Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model, which explicitly accounts
  for the data geometry. This enables us to define geometry-aware notions of distance
  and shortest paths in the latent space, while ensuring that our model only assigns
  probability mass to the data manifold. This generalizes previous work and allows
  us to handle complex tasks in various domains, including robot motion synthesis
  and analysis of brain connectomes.
