abstract: 'Statistical heterogeneity of clientsâ€™ local data is an important characteristic
  in federated learning, motivating personalized algorithms tailored to local data
  statistics. Though there has been a plethora of algorithms proposed for personalized
  supervised learning, discovering the structure of local data through personalized
  unsupervised learning is less explored. We initiate a systematic study of such personalized
  unsupervised learning by developing algorithms based on optimization criteria inspired
  by a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework. We develop adaptive algorithms
  that discover the balance between using limited local data and collaborative information.
  We do this in the context of two unsupervised learning tasks: personalized dimensionality
  reduction (ADEPT-PCA and ADEPT-AE) and personalized diffusion models (ADEPT-DGM).
  We develop convergence analyses for our adaptive algorithms which illustrate the
  dependence on problem parameters (e.g., heterogeneity, local sample size). We also
  develop a theoretical framework for personalized diffusion models, which shows the
  benefits of collaboration even under heterogeneity. We finally evaluate our proposed
  algorithms using synthetic and real data, demonstrating the effective sample amplification
  for personalized tasks, induced through collaboration, despite data heterogeneity.'
