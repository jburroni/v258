title: " Regularity in Canonicalized Models: A Theoretical Perspective "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=tBcxoC05At "
abstract: " In learning with invariances (or symmetries), canonicalization is a widely
  used technique that projects data onto a smaller subset of the input space to reduce
  associated redundancies. The transformed dataset is then processed through a function
  from a designated function class to obtain the final invariant representation. Although
  canonicalization is often simple and flexible, both theoretical and empirical evidence
  suggests that the projection map can be discontinuous and unstable, which poses
  challenges for machine learning applications. However, the overall end-to-end representation
  can still remain continuous. Focusing on the importance of end-to-end regularity
  rather than the projection mapping itself, this paper explores the continuity and
  regularity of canonicalized models from a theoretical perspective. In a broad setting
  of input spaces and group actions, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions
  for the continuity or regularity of canonicalized models of any order, thereby characterizing
  the minimal conditions required for stability. To our knowledge, this represents
  the first comprehensive investigation into the end-to-end regularity of canonicalized
  models, offering critical insights into their design and application, as well as
  guidance for enhancing stability in practical settings. "
