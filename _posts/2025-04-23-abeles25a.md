title: " Online-to-PAC generalization bounds under graph-mixing dependencies "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=MEM4qrGowq "
abstract: " Traditional generalization results in statistical learning require a training
  data set made of independently drawn examples. Most of the recent efforts to relax
  this independence assumption have considered either purely temporal (mixing) dependencies,
  or graph-dependencies, where non-adjacent vertices correspond to independent random
  variables. Both approaches have their own limitations, the former requiring a temporal
  ordered structure, and the latter lacking a way to quantify the strength of inter-dependencies.
  In this work, we bridge these two lines of work by proposing a framework where dependencies
  decay with graph distance. We derive generalization bounds leveraging the online-to-PAC
  framework, by deriving a novel concentration result and introducing an online learning
  framework incorporating the graph structure. The resulting high-probability generalization
  guarantees depend on both the mixing rate and the graph’s chromatic number. "
