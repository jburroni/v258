abstract: " Iterative sketching and sketch-and-precondition are well-established randomized
  algorithms for solving large-scale over-determined linear least-squares problems.
  In this paper, we introduce a new perspective that interprets Iterative Sketching
  and Sketching-and-Precondition as forms of Iterative Refinement. We also examine
  the numerical stability of two distinct refinement strategies: iterative refinement
  and recursive refinement, which progressively improve the accuracy of a sketched
  linear solver. Building on this insight, we propose a novel algorithm, Sketched
  Iterative and Recursive Refinement (SIRR), which combines both refinement methods.
  \ SIRR demonstrates a four order of magnitude improvement in backward error compared
  to iterative sketching, achieved simply by reorganizing the computational order,
  ensuring that the computed solution exactly solves a modified least-squares system
  where the coefficient matrix deviates only slightly from the original matrix. To
  the best of our knowledge, SIRR is the first asymptotically fast, single-stage randomized
  least-squares solver that achieves both forward and backward stability. "
