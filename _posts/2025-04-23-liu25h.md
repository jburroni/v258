  Dependent Competing Risks "

abstract: " In survival analysis, subjects often face competing risks; for example,
  individuals with cancer may also suffer from heart disease or other illnesses, which
  can jointly influence the prognosis of risks and censoring. Traditional survival
  analysis methods often treat competing risks as independent and fail to accommodate
  the dependencies between different conditions. In this paper, we introduce HACSurv,
  a survival analysis method that learns Hierarchical Archimedean Copulas structures
  and cause-specific survival functions from data with competing risks. HACSurv employs
  a flexible dependency structure using hierarchical Archimedean copulas to represent
  the relationships between competing risks and censoring. By capturing the dependencies
  between risks and censoring, HACSurv improves the accuracy of survival predictions
  and offers insights into risk interactions. Experiments on synthetic dataset demonstrate
  that our method can accurately identify the complex dependency structure and precisely
  predict survival distributions, whereas the compared methods exhibit significant
  deviations between their predictions and the true distributions. Experiments on
  multiple real-world datasets also demonstrate that our method achieves better survival
  prediction compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. "
