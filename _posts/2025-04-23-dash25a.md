abstract: Acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMG) – graphs that contain both directed
  and bidi- rected edges but no directed cycles – are used to model causal and conditional
  independence relationships between a set of random vari- ables in the presence of
  latent or unmeasured variables. Bow-free ADMGs, Arid ADMGs, and Ancestral ADMGs
  (AADMG) are three widely studied classes of ADMGs where each class is contained
  in the previously mentioned class. There are a number of published meth- ods – primarily
  heuristic ones – to find score- maximizing AADMGs from data. Bow-free and Arid ADMGs
  can model certain equal- ity restrictions – such as Verma constraints – between
  observed variables that maximal AADMGs cannot. In this work, we develop the first
  exact methods – based on integer programming – to find score-maximizing Bow- free
  and Arid ADMGs. Our methods work for data that follows a continuous Gaussian distri-
  bution and for scores that linearly decompose into the sum of scores of c-components
  of an ADMG. To improve scaling, we develop an effective linear-programming based
  heuris- tic that yields solutions with high parent set sizes and/or large districts.
  We show that our proposed algorithms obtain better scores than other state-of-the-art
  methods and re- turn graphs that have excellent fits to data.
