abstract: " Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating
  the effect of new medical treatments. Treatments must pass stringent regulatory
  conditions in order to be approved for widespread use, yet even after the regulatory
  barriers are crossed, real-world challenges might arise: Who should get the treatment?
  What is its true clinical utility? Are there discrepancies in the treatment effectiveness
  across diverse and under-served populations? We introduce two new objectives for
  future clinical trials that integrate regulatory constraints and treatment policy
  value for both the entire population and under-served populations, thus answering
  some of the questions above in advance. Designed to meet these objectives, we formulate
  Randomize First Augment Next (RFAN), a new framework for designing Phase III clinical
  trials. Our framework consists of a standard randomized component followed by an
  adaptive one, jointly meant to efficiently and safely acquire and assign patients
  into treatment arms during the trial. Then, we propose strategies for implementing
  RFAN based on causal, deep Bayesian active learning. Finally, we empirically evaluate
  the performance of our framework using synthetic and real-world semi-synthetic datasets. "
