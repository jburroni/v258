title: Large Covariance Matrix Estimation With Nonnegative Correlations
software: https://github.com/dsailab/SparseCovEst_NonNeg
openreview: cVukn0ZUO8
abstract: 'Covariance matrix estimation is a fundamental problem in multivariate data
  analysis.  In many situations, it is often observed that variables exhibit a positive
  linear dependency, indicating a positive linear correlation. This paper tackles
  the challenge of estimating covariance matrices with positive correlations in high-dimensional
  settings. We propose a positive definite thresholding covariance estimation problem
  that includes nonconvex sparsity penalties and nonnegative correlation constraints.
  To address this problem, we introduce a multistage adaptive estimation algorithm
  based on majorization-minimization (MM). This algorithm progressively refines the
  estimates by solving a weighted $\ell_{1}$-regularized problem at each stage. Additionally,
  we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis that characterizes the estimation
  error associated with the estimates generated by the MM algorithm. The analysis
  reveals that the error comprises two components: the optimization error and the
  statistical error. The optimization error decreases to zero at a linear rate, allowing
  the proposed estimator to eventually reach the oracle statistical rate under mild
  conditions. Furthermore, we explore various extensions based on the proposed estimation
  technique. Our theoretical findings are supported by extensive numerical experiments
  conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate
  that the proposed estimation technique can be expanded to the correlation matrix
  estimation scenario. Our theoretical findings are corroborated through extensive
  numerical experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets.'
