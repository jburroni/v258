title: Near-Polynomially Competitive Active Logistic Regression
software: https://github.com/trung6/ActLogReg
openreview: BVQ8rIFuYa
abstract: We address the problem of active logistic regression in the realizable setting.
  It is well known that active learning can require exponentially fewer label queries
  compared to passive learning, in some cases using $\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ rather
  than $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$ samples to get error $\varepsilon$ larger than
  the optimum. We present the first algorithm that is polynomially competitive with
  the optimal algorithm on every input instance, up to factors polylogarithmic in
  the error and domain size.  In particular, if any algorithm achieves label complexity
  polylogarithmic in $\varepsilon$, so does ours.  Our algorithm is based on efficient
  sampling and can be extended to learn more general class of functions. We further
  support our theoretical results with experiments demonstrating performance gains
  for logistic regression compared to existing active learning algorithms.
