title: " Optimal downsampling for Imbalanced Classification with Generalized Linear
  Models "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZleVCnq1tS "
abstract: " Downsampling or under-sampling is a technique that is utilized in the
  context of large and highly imbalanced classification models. We study optimal downsampling
  for imbalanced classification using generalized linear models (GLMs). We propose
  a pseudo maximum likelihood estimator and study its asymptotic normality in the
  context of increasingly imbalanced populations relative to an increasingly large
  sample size.  We provide theoretical guarantees for the introduced estimator. Additionally,
  we compute the optimal downsampling rate using a criterion that balances statistical
  accuracy and computational efficiency. Our numerical experiments, conducted on both
  synthetic and empirical data, further validate our theoretical results, and demonstrate
  that the introduced estimator outperforms commonly available alternatives. "
