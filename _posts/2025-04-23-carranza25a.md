abstract: " We consider the problem of using observational bandit feedback data from
  multiple heterogeneous data sources to learn a personalized decision policy that
  robustly generalizes across diverse target settings. To achieve this, we propose
  a minimax regret optimization objective to ensure uniformly low regret under general
  mixtures of the source distributions. We develop a policy learning algorithm tailored
  to this objective, combining doubly robust offline policy evaluation techniques
  and no-regret learning algorithms for minimax optimization. Our regret analysis
  shows that this approach achieves the minimal worst-case mixture regret up to a
  moderated vanishing rate of the total data across all sources. Our analysis, extensions,
  and experimental results demonstrate the benefits of this approach for learning
  robust decision policies from multiple data sources. "
