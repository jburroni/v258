title: Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Online Concave Packing and Convex Covering
  Problems
openreview: NgltBQndiq
abstract: "\\emph{Learning-augmented algorithms} have been extensively studied in
  the computer science community recently, particularly in the context of online problems,
  in which machine-learning predictors can help provide additional information about
  the future, in order to overcome classical impossibility results. Such algorithms
  use \\emph{advice} prudently to improve the performance of classical algorithms,
  while ensuring robustness against inaccurate advice. In this paper, we present learning-augmented
  algorithmic frameworks for two fundamental optimizations settings, extending and
  generalizing prior works. For \\emph{online packing with concave objectives}, we
  present a simple but overarching strategy that \\emph{switches} between the advice
  and the state-of-the-art online algorithm. For \\emph{online covering with convex
  objectives}, we greatly extend primal-dual methods for online convex covering programs
  and previous learning-augmented framework for online covering linear programs from
  the literature, to many new applications. We show that our algorithms break impossibility
  results when the advice is accurate, while maintaining comparable performance with
  state-of-the-art classical online algorithms even when the advice is erroneous."
