title: Type Information-Assisted Self-Supervised Knowledge Graph Denoising

abstract: Knowledge graphs serve as critical resources supporting intelligent systems,
  but they can be noisy due to imperfect automatic generation processes. Existing
  approaches to noise detection often rely on external facts, logical rule constraints,
  or structural embeddings. These methods are often challenged by imperfect entity
  alignment, flexible knowledge graph construction, and overfitting on structures.
  In this paper, we propose to exploit the consistency between entity and relation
  type information for noise detection, resulting a novel self-supervised knowledge
  graph denoising method that avoids those problems. We formalize \textit{type inconsistency}
  noise as triples that deviate from the majority with respect to type-dependent reasoning
  along the topological structure. Specifically, we first extract a compact representation
  of a given knowledge graph via an encoder that models the type dependencies of triples.
  Then, the decoder reconstructs the original input knowledge graph based on the compact
  representation. It is worth noting that, our proposal has the potential to address
  the problems of knowledge graph compression and completion, although this is not
  our focus. For the specific task of noise detection, the discrepancy between the
  reconstruction results and the input knowledge graph provides an opportunity for
  denoising, which is facilitated by the type consistency embedded in our method.
  Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in detecting
  potential noise in real-world data.
