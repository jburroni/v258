title: 'Bayes without Underfitting: Fully Correlated Deep Learning Posteriors via
  Alternating Projections'
software: https://github.com/h-roy/projected-bayes
openreview: iaeFTpT3e7
abstract: 'Bayesian deep learning all too often underfits so that the Bayesian prediction
  is less accurate than a simple point estimate. Uncertainty quantification then comes
  at the cost of accuracy. For linearized models, the null space of the generalized
  Gauss-Newton matrix corresponds to parameters that preserve the training predictions
  of the point estimate. We propose to build Bayesian approximations in this null
  space, thereby guaranteeing that the Bayesian predictive does not underfit. We suggest
  a matrix-free algorithm for projecting onto this null space, which scales linearly
  with the number of parameters and quadratically with the number of output dimensions.
  We further propose an approximation that only scales linearly with parameters to
  make the method applicable to generative models. An extensive empirical evaluation
  shows that the approach scales to large models, including vision transformers with
  28 million parameters. Code is available at: \url{https://github.com/h-roy/projected-bayes}'
