abstract: " In restless multi-arm bandits, a central agent is tasked with optimally
  distributing limited resources across several bandits (arms), with each arm being
  a Markov decision process. In this work, we generalize the traditional restless
  multi-arm bandit problem with a risk-neutral objective by incorporating risk-awareness.
  We establish indexability conditions for the case of a risk-aware objective and
  provide a solution based on Whittle index. In addition, we address the learning
  problem when the true transition probabilities are unknown by proposing a Thompson
  sampling approach and show that it achieves bounded regret that scales sublinearly
  with the number of episodes and quadratically with the number of arms. The efficacy
  of our method in reducing risk exposure in restless multi-arm bandits is illustrated
  through a set of numerical experiments in the contexts of machine replacement and
  patient scheduling applications under both planning and learning setups. "
