title: " A Safe Exploration Approach to Constrained Markov Decision Processes "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=gpsym9QNoN "
abstract: " We consider discounted infinite-horizon constrained Markov decision processes
  (CMDPs), where the goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the expected
  cumulative reward while satisfying expected cumulative constraints. Motivated by
  the application of CMDPs in online learning for safety-critical systems, we focus
  on developing a model-free and $\\textit{simulator-free}$ algorithm that ensures
  $\\textit{constraint satisfaction during learning}$. To this end, we employ the
  LB-SGD algorithm proposed in (Usmanova et al., 2024), which utilizes an interior-point
  approach based on the log-barrier function of the CMDP. Under the commonly assumed
  conditions of relaxed Fisher non-degeneracy and bounded transfer error in policy
  parameterization, we establish the theoretical properties of the LB-SGD algorithm.
  In particular, unlike existing CMDP approaches that ensure policy feasibility only
  upon convergence, the LB-SGD algorithm guarantees feasibility throughout the learning
  process and converges to the $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with a sample complexity
  of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-6})$. Compared to the state-of-the-art
  policy gradient-based algorithm, C-NPG-PDA, the LB-SGD algorithm requires an additional
  $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples to ensure policy feasibility during learning
  with the same Fisher non-degenerate parameterization. "
