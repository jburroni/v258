abstract: 'Conditional simulation is a fundamental task in statistical modeling: Generate
  samples from the conditionals given finitely many data points from a joint distribution.
  One promising approach is to construct conditional Brenier maps, where the components
  of the map pushforward a reference distribution to conditionals of the target. While
  many estimators exist, few, if any, come with statistical or algorithmic guarantees.
  To this end, we propose a non-parametric estimator for conditional Brenier maps
  based on the computational scalability of \emph{entropic} optimal transport. Our
  estimator leverages a result of Carlier et al., (2010), which shows that optimal
  transport maps under a rescaled quadratic cost asymptotically converge to conditional
  Brenier maps; our estimator is precisely the entropic analogues of these converging
  maps. We provide heuristic justifications for how to choose the scaling parameter
  in the cost as a function of the number of samples by fully characterizing the Gaussian
  setting. We conclude by comparing the performance of the estimator to other machine
  learning and non-parametric approaches on benchmark datasets and Bayesian inference
  problems.'
