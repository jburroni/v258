abstract: " The goal of the Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) task is to identify
  the underlying reward function and the corresponding optimal policy from a set of
  expert demonstrations. While most IRL algorithmsâ€™ theoretical guarantees rely on
  a linear reward structure, we aim to extend the theoretical understanding of IRL
  to scenarios where the reward function is parameterized by neural networks.  Meanwhile,
  conventional IRL algorithms usually adopt a nested structure, leading to computational
  inefficiency, especially in high-dimensional settings. To address this problem,
  we propose the first two-timescale single-loop IRL algorithm under neural network
  parameterized reward and provide a non-asymptotic convergence analysis under overparameterization.
  Although prior optimality results for linear rewards do not apply, we show that
  our algorithm can identify the globally optimal reward and policy under certain
  neural network structures. This is the first IRL algorithm with a non-asymptotic
  convergence guarantee that provably achieves global optimality in neural network
  settings. "
