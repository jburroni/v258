title: " Achieving $\\widetilde\\mathcalO(\\sqrtT)$ Regret in Average-Reward POMDPs
  with Known Observation Models "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=3R5K51d9kr "
abstract: " We tackle average-reward infinite-horizon POMDPs with an unknown transition
  model but a known observation model, a setting that has been previously addressed
  in two limiting ways: (i) frequentist methods relying on suboptimal stochastic policies
  having a minimum probability of choosing each action, and (ii) Bayesian approaches
  employing the optimal policy class but requiring strong assumptions about the consistency
  of employed estimators. Our work removes these limitations by proving convenient
  estimation guarantees for the transition model and introducing an optimistic algorithm
  that leverages the optimal class of deterministic belief-based policies.   We introduce
  modifications to existing estimation techniques providing theoretical guarantees
  separately for each estimated action transition matrix. Unlike existing estimation
  methods that are unable to use samples from different policies, we present a novel
  and simple estimator that overcomes this barrier. This new data-efficient technique,
  combined with the proposed $\\textit{Action-wise OAS-UCRL}$ algorithm and a tighter
  theoretical analysis, leads to the first approach enjoying a regret guarantee of
  order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ when compared against the optimal policy,
  thus improving over state of the art techniques. Finally, theoretical results are
  validated through numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our method against
  baseline methods. "
