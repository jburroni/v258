abstract: " Retrosynthesis poses a key challenge in biopharmaceuticals, aiding chemists
  in finding appropriate reactant molecules for given product molecules. With reactants
  and products represented as 2D graphs, retrosynthesis constitutes a conditional
  graph-to-graph (G2G) generative task. Inspired by advancements in discrete diffusion
  models for graph generation, we aim to design a diffusion-based method to address
  this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based G2G framework while retaining
  essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our
  key innovation involves a multi-stage diffusion process. We decompose the retrosynthesis
  procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products,
  then generate external bonds to connect products and generated groups. Interestingly,
  this generation process mirrors the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template
  retrosynthesis workflow, i.e., from reaction center identification to synthon completion.
  Based on these designs, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel
  diffusion-based method for the retrosynthesis task. Experimental results demonstrate
  that RetroDiff surpasses all semi-template methods in accuracy, and outperforms
  template-based and template-free methods in large-scale scenarios and molecular
  validity, respectively. "
