abstract: " An informal observation, made by several authors, is that the adaptive
  design of a Markov transition kernel has the flavour of a reinforcement learning
  task.  Yet, to-date it has remained unclear how to exploit modern reinforcement
  learning technologies for adaptive MCMC.  The aim of this paper is to set out a
  general framework, called \\emph{Reinforcement Learning Metropolis—Hastings}, that
  is theoretically supported and empirically validated.  Our principal focus is on
  learning fast-mixing Metropolis—Hastings transition kernels, which we cast as deterministic
  policies and optimise via a policy gradient.  Control of the learning rate provably
  ensures conditions for ergodicity are satisfied.  The methodology is used to construct
  a gradient-free sampler that out-performs a popular gradient-free adaptive Metropolis–Hastings
  algorithm on $\\approx$90% of tasks in the \\emph{PosteriorDB} benchmark. "
