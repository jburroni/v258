abstract: " In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
  significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the widely
  used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative settings, where
  the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the fidelity of its generation.
  In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation remain ambiguously defined across
  the literature. In this work, we adopt a practical approach that examines DRL from
  a task-driven perspective. We propose a unified framework that explores the usefulness
  of discrete features in relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally
  viewed as one possible application. In this context, the properties of discrete
  representations as well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively
  understudied. We therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off
  between representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
  representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate the
  flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications. "
