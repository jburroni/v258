title: A graphical global optimization framework for parameter estimation of statistical
  models with nonconvex regularization functions
openreview: mBbC5pzZxL
abstract: Optimization problems with norm-bounding constraints appear in various applications,
  from portfolio optimization to machine learning, feature selection, and beyond.
  A widely used variant of these problems relaxes the norm-bounding constraint through
  Lagrangian relaxation and moves it to the objective function as a form of penalty
  or regularization term. A challenging class of these models uses the zero-norm function
  to induce sparsity in statistical parameter estimation models. Most existing exact
  solution methods for these problems use additional binary variables together with
  artificial bounds on variables to formulate them as a mixed-integer program in a
  higher dimension, which is then solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Other exact methods
  utilize specific structural properties of the objective function to solve certain
  variants of these problems, making them non-generalizable to other problems with
  different structures. An alternative approach employs nonconvex penalties with desirable
  statistical properties, which are solved using heuristic or local methods due to
  the structural complexity of those terms. In this paper, we develop a novel graph-based
  method to globally solve optimization problems that contain a generalization of
  norm-bounding constraints. This includes standard $\ell_p$-norms for $p \in [0,
  \infty)$ as well as nonconvex penalty terms, such as SCAD and MCP, as special cases.
  Our method uses decision diagrams to build strong convex relaxations for these constraints
  in the original space of variables without the need to introduce additional auxiliary
  variables or impose artificial variable bounds. We show that the resulting convexification
  method, when incorporated into a spatial branch-and-cut framework, converges to
  the global optimal value of the problem. To demonstrate the capabilities of the
  proposed framework, we conduct preliminary computational experiments on benchmark
  sparse linear regression problems with challenging nonconvex penalty terms that
  cannot be modeled or solved by existing global solvers.
