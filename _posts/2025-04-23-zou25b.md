abstract: " Despite a large and significant body of recent work focusing on the hyperparameter
  tuning of regularized models in the high dimensional regime, a theoretical understanding
  of this problem for non-differentiable penalties such as generalized LASSO and nuclear
  norm is missing. In this paper we resolve this challenge. We study the hyperparameter
  tuning problem in the proportional high dimensional regime where both the sample
  size $n$ and number of features $p$ are large, and $n/p$ and the signal-to-noise
  ratio (per observation) remain finite. To achieve this goal, we first provide finite-sample
  upper bounds on the expected squared error of leave-one-out cross-validation (LO)
  in estimating the out-of-sample risk. Building on this result, we establish the
  consistency of the hyperparameter tuning method that is based on minimizing LOâ€™s
  estimate. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy and sharpness of our theoretical
  results. "
