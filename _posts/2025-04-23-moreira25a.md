title: Learning Visual-Semantic Subspace Representations
software: https://github.com/gabmoreira/subspaces
openreview: R3O1mD9lyZ
abstract: Learning image representations that capture rich semantic relationships
  remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are either contrastive, lacking
  robust theoretical guarantees, or struggle to effectively represent the partial
  orders inherent to structured visual-semantic data. In this paper, we introduce
  a nuclear norm-based loss function, grounded in the same information theoretic principles
  that have proved effective in self-supervised learning. We present a theoretical
  characterization of this loss, demonstrating that, in addition to promoting class
  orthogonality, it encodes the spectral geometry of the data within a subspace lattice.
  This geometric representation allows us to associate logical propositions with subspaces,
  ensuring that our learned representations adhere to a predefined symbolic structure.
