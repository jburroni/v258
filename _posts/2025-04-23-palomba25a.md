title: A Causal Framework for Evaluating Deferring Systems
software: https://github.com/andrepugni/PODS
openreview: mkkFubLdNW
abstract: Deferring systems extend supervised Machine Learning (ML) models with the
  possibility to defer predictions to human experts. However, evaluating the impact
  of a deferring strategy on system accuracy is still an overlooked area. This paper
  fills this gap by evaluating deferring systems through a causal lens. We link the
  potential outcomes framework for causal inference with deferring systems, which
  allows to identify the causal impact of the deferring strategy on predictive accuracy.
  We distinguish two scenarios. In the first one, we have access to both the human
  and ML model predictions for the deferred instances. Here, we can identify the individual
  causal effects for deferred instances and the aggregates of them. In the second
  one, only human predictions are available for the deferred instances. Here, we can
  resort to regression discontinuity design to estimate a local causal effect. We
  evaluate our approach on synthetic and real datasets for seven deferring systems
  from the literature.
