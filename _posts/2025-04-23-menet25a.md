title: 'LITE: Efficiently Estimating Gaussian Probability of Maximality'
software: https://github.com/lasgroup/LITE
openreview: ag4zg75Wyc
abstract: We consider the problem of computing the \emph{probability of maximality}
  (PoM) of a Gaussian random vector, i.e., the probability for each dimension to be
  maximal. This is a key challenge in applications ranging from Bayesian optimization
  to reinforcement learning, where the PoM not only helps with finding an optimal
  action, but yields a fine-grained analysis of the action domain, crucial in tasks
  such as drug discovery. Existing techniques are costly, scaling polynomially in
  computation and memory with the vector size. We introduce LITE, the first approach
  for estimating Gaussian PoM with \emph{almost-linear time and memory} complexity.
  LITE achieves SOTA accuracy on a number of tasks, while being in practice several
  orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. This also translates to a better
  performance on downstream tasks such as entropy estimation and optimal control of
  bandits. Theoretically, we cast LITE as entropy-regularized UCB and connect it to
  prior PoM estimators.
