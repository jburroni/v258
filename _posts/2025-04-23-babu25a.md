title: Unbiased Quantization of the $L_1$ Ball for Communication-Efficient Distributed
  Mean Estimation
software: https://github.com/Ritesh622/Unbiased-Quantization-Distributed-Mean-Estimation
openreview: AdXSZNm3SL
abstract: We study the problem of unbiased minimum mean squared error quantization
  of the $L_1$ ball, with applications to distributed mean estimation and federated
  learning. Inspired by quantization of probability distributions using types, we
  design a novel computationally efficient unbiased quantization scheme for vectors
  that lie within the $L_1$ ball. We also derive upper bounds on the worst-case mean
  squared error achieved by our scheme and show that this is order optimal. We then
  use this to design polynomial (in the dimension of the input vectors)-time schemes
  for communication-efficient distributed mean estimation and distributed/federated
  learning, and demonstrate its effectiveness using simulations.
