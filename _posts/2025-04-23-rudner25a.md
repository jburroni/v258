abstract: " Fine-tuning off-the-shelf pre-trained neural networks has become the default
  starting point for a wide range of challenging prediction tasksâ€”especially in computer
  vision and natural language processing, where pre-trained models trained on millions
  or even billions of data points are publicly available and can be fine-tuned with
  a moderate compute budget. However, while fine-tuned models have been shown to significantly
  improve predictive performance compared to models trained from scratch, they can
  exhibit poor calibration and fail to reliably identify challenging distribution
  shifts. In this paper, we improve uncertainty quantification in fine-tuned models
  by constructing a data-driven uncertainty-aware fine-tuning prior that assigns high
  probability density to parameters that induce predictive functions with high uncertainty
  on input points that are meaningfully different from the data. We derive a tractable
  variational objective to perform approximate inference in models with data-driven
  uncertainty-aware priors and evaluate models fine-tuned with such priors on different
  transfer learning tasks. We show that fine-tuning with uncertainty-aware priors
  significantly improves calibration, selective prediction, and semantic shift detection
  on computer vision and natural language classification tasks. "
