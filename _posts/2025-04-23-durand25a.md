title: " Out-of-distribution robustness for multivariate analysis via causal regularisation "
software: " https://github.com/homerdurand/anchorMVA "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=jMV46QmlAB "
abstract: " We propose a regularisation strategy of classical machine learning algorithms
  rooted in causality that ensures robustness against distribution shifts. Building
  upon the anchor regression framework, we demonstrate how incorporating a straightforward
  regularisation term into the loss function of classical multivariate analysis algorithms,
  such as (orthonormalized) partial least squares, reduced-rank regression, and multiple
  linear regression, enables out-of-distribution generalisation. Our framework allows
  users to efficiently verify the compatibility of a loss function with the regularisation
  strategy. Estimators for selected algorithms are provided, showcasing consistency
  and efficacy in synthetic and real-world climate science problems. The empirical
  validation highlights the versatility of anchor regularisation, emphasizing its
  compatibility with multivariate analysis approaches and its role in enhancing replicability
  while guarding against distribution shifts. The extended anchor framework advances
  causal inference methodologies, addressing the need for reliable out-of-distribution
  generalisation. "
