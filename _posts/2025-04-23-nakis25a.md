abstract: " Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant
  attention in recent years for their ability to learn informative latent representations
  of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders,
  there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based
  graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this
  gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE
  extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct
  extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved
  by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization.
  The framework employs the Skellam distribution for analyzing signed networks combined
  with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates
  the SGAAEsâ€™ capability to successfully infer node memberships over underlying latent
  structures while extracting competing communities. Additionally, we introduce the
  2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize
  such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks
  of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several
  baseline models. Finally, SGAAE allows for interpretable visualizations in the polytope
  space, revealing the distinct aspects of the network, as well as, how nodes are
  expressing them. "
