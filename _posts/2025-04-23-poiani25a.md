abstract: " We study the fixed-confidence best-arm identification problem in unimodal
  bandits, in which the means of the arms increase with the index of the arm up to
  their maximum, then decrease. We derive two lower bounds on the stopping time of
  any algorithm. The instance-dependent lower bound suggests that due to the unimodal
  structure, only three arms contribute to the leading confidence-dependent cost.
  However, a worst-case lower bound shows that a linear dependence on the number of
  arms is unavoidable in the confidence-independent cost. We propose modifications
  of Track-and-Stop and a Top Two algorithm that leverage the unimodal structure.
  Both versions of Track-and-Stop are asymptotically optimal for one-parameter exponential
  families. The Top Two algorithm is asymptotically near-optimal for Gaussian distributions
  and we prove a non-asymptotic guarantee matching the worse-case lower bound. The
  algorithms can be implemented efficiently and we demonstrate their competitive empirical
  performance. "
