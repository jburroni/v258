abstract: As probabilistic models continue to permeate various facets of our society
  and contribute to scientific advancements, it becomes a necessity to go beyond traditional
  metrics such as predictive accuracy and error rates and assess their trustworthiness.
  Grounded in the competence-based theory of trust, this work formalizes $\mathcal{I}$-trustworthy
  framework â€“ a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of probabilistic
  classifiers for inference tasks by linking conditional calibration to trustworthiness.
  To assess $\mathcal{I}$-trustworthiness, we use the local calibration error (LCE)
  and develop a method of hypothesis-testing. This method utilizes a kernel-based
  test statistic, Kernel Local Calibration Error (KLCE), to test local calibration
  of a probabilistic classifier. This study provides theoretical guarantees by offering
  convergence bounds for an unbiased estimator of KLCE. Additionally, we present a
  diagnostic tool designed to identify and measure biases in cases of miscalibration.
  The effectiveness of the proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application
  to both simulated and real-world datasets. Finally, LCE of related recalibration
  methods is studied, and we provide evidence of insufficiency of existing methods
  to achieve I-trustworthiness.
