abstract: " In causal inference with observational studies, synthetic control (SC)
  has emerged as a prominent tool. SC has traditionally been applied to aggregate-level
  datasets, but more recent work has extended its use to individual-level data. As
  they contain a greater number of observed units, this shift introduces the curse
  of dimensionality to SC. To address this, we propose Cluster Synthetic Control (ClusterSC),
  based on the idea that groups of individuals may exist where behavior aligns internally
  but diverges between groups. ClusterSC incorporates a clustering step to select
  only the relevant donors for the target. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
  improvements induced by ClusterSC, supported by empirical demonstrations on synthetic
  and real-world datasets. The results indicate that ClusterSC consistently outperforms
  classical SC approaches. "
