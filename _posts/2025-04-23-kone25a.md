abstract: " The problem of identifying the best answer among a collection of items
  having real-valued distribution is well-understood.  Despite its practical relevance
  for many applications, fewer works have studied its extension when multiple and
  potentially conflicting metrics are available to assess an itemâ€™s quality. Pareto
  set identification (PSI) aims to identify the set of answers whose means are not
  uniformly worse than another. This paper studies PSI in the transductive linear
  setting with potentially correlated objectives. Building on posterior sampling in
  both the stopping and the sampling rules, we propose the \\hyperlink{PSIPS}{PSIPS}
  algorithm that deals simultaneously with structure and correlation without paying
  the computational cost of existing oracle-based algorithms. Both from a frequentist
  and Bayesian perspective, \\hyperlink{PSIPS}{PSIPS} is asymptotically optimal. We
  demonstrate its good empirical performance in real-world and synthetic instances. "
