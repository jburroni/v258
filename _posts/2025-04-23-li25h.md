title: Towards Cost Sensitive Decision Making

abstract: Many real-world situations allow for the acquisition of additional relevant
  information when making decisions with limited or uncertain data. However, traditional
  RL approaches either require all features to be acquired beforehand (e.g. in a MDP)
  or regard part of them as missing data that cannot be acquired (e.g. in a POMDP).
  In this work, we consider RL models that may actively acquire features from the
  environment to improve the decision quality and certainty, while automatically balancing
  the cost of feature acquisition process and the reward of task decision process.
  We propose the Active-Acquisition POMDP and identify two types of the acquisition
  process for different application domains. In order to assist the agent in the actively-acquired
  partially-observed environment and alleviate the exploration-exploitation dilemma,
  we develop a model-based approach, where a deep generative model is utilized to
  capture the dependencies of the features and impute the unobserved features. The
  imputations essentially represent the beliefs of the agent. Equipped with the dynamics
  model, we develop hierarchical RL algorithms to resolve both types of the AA-POMDPs.
  Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves considerably better performance
  than existing POMDP-RL solutions.
