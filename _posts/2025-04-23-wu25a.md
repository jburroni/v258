title: Conditional Prediction ROC Bands for Graph Classification
software: https://github.com/CS-SAIL/UQ-GNN-ROC.git
openreview: 8GJmWyhD4b
abstract: Graph classification in medical imaging and drug discovery requires accuracy
  and robust uncertainty quantification. To address this need, we introduce Conditional
  Prediction ROC (CP-ROC) bands, offering uncertainty quantification for ROC curves
  and robustness to distributional shifts in test data. Although developed for Tensorized
  Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs), CP-ROC is adaptable to general Graph Neural Networks
  (GNNs) and other machine learning models. We establish statistically guaranteed
  coverage for CP-ROC under a local exchangeability condition. This addresses uncertainty
  challenges for ROC curves under non-iid setting, ensuring reliability when test
  graph distributions differ from training data. Empirically, to establish local exchangeability
  for TGNNs, we introduce a data-driven approach to construct local calibration sets
  for graphs. Comprehensive evaluations show that CP-ROC significantly improves prediction
  reliability across diverse tasks. This method enhances uncertainty quantification
  efficiency and reliability for ROC curves, proving valuable for real-world applications
  with non-iid objects.
