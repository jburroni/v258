title: Narrowing the Gap between Adversarial and Stochastic MDPs via Policy Optimization
openreview: 9gaGhPzo5w
abstract: 'We consider the problem of learning in adversarial Markov decision processes
  [MDPs] with an oblivious adversary in a full-information setting. The agent interacts
  with an environment during $T$ episodes, each of which consists of $H$ stages, and
  each episode is evaluated with respect to a reward function that will be revealed
  only at the end of the episode. We propose an algorithm, called APO-MVP, that achieves
  a regret bound of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(H)\sqrt{SAT})$, where
  $S$ and $A$ are sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively. This result
  improves upon the best-known regret bound by a factor of $\sqrt{S}$, bridging the
  gap between adversarial and stochastic MDPs, and matching the minimax lower bound
  $\Omega(\sqrt{H^3SAT})$ as far as the dependencies in $S,A,T$ are concerned. The
  proposed algorithm and analysis completely avoid the typical tool given by occupancy
  measures; instead, it performs policy optimization based only on dynamic programming
  and on a black-box online linear optimization strategy run over estimated advantage
  functions, making it easy to implement. The analysis leverages two recent techniques:
  policy optimization based on online linear optimization strategies (Jonckheere et
  al., 2023) and a refined martingale analysis of the impact on values of estimating
  transitions kernels (Zhang et al., 2023).'
