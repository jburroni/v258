title: Learning Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Linear Mixture MDPs of Bounded Span
software: https://github.com/ChaeWoojin/UCLK-C
openreview: u1ZmPMu3yD
abstract: This paper proposes a computationally tractable algorithm for learning infinite-horizon
  average-reward linear mixture Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the Bellman
  optimality condition. Our algorithm for linear mixture MDPs achieves a nearly minimax
  optimal regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{\mathrm{sp}(v^*)T})$
  over $T$ time steps where $\mathrm{sp}(v^*)$ is the span of the optimal bias function
  $v^*$ and $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping. Our algorithm applies the
  recently developed technique of running value iteration on a discounted-reward MDP
  approximation with clipping by the span. We prove that the value iteration procedure,
  even with the clipping operation, converges. Moreover, we show that the associated
  variance term due to random transitions can be bounded even under clipping. Combined
  with the weighted ridge regression-based parameter estimation scheme, this leads
  to the nearly minimax optimal regret guarantee.
