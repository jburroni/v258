abstract: " Accurate quantification of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties
  is essential when deploying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in high-stakes applications
  such as drug discovery and financial fraud detection, where reliable predictions
  are critical. Although Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) efficiently quantifies uncertainty
  using a Dirichlet distribution over predictive probabilities, existing EDL-based
  GNN (EGNN) models require modifications to the network architecture and retraining,
  failing to take advantage of pre-trained models. We propose a plug-and-play framework
  for uncertainty quantification in GNNs that works with pre-trained models without
  the need for retraining.  Our Evidential Probing Network (EPN) uses a lightweight
  Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) head to extract evidence from learned representations,
  allowing efficient integration with various GNN architectures.  We further introduce
  evidence-based regularization techniques, referred to as EPN-reg, to enhance the
  estimation of epistemic uncertainty with theoretical justifications.  Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that the proposed EPN-reg achieves state-of-the-art performance
  in accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for real-world
  deployment. "
