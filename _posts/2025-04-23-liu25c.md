title: Perfect Recovery for Random Geometric Graph Matching with Shallow Graph Neural
  Networks
software: https://github.com/6457/matchgnn/
openreview: 6gKgmdMlkj
abstract: We study the graph matching problem in the presence of vertex feature information
  using shallow graph neural networks. Specifically, given two graphs that are independent
  perturbations of a single random geometric graph with sparse binary features, the
  task is to recover an unknown one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the two
  graphs. We show under certain conditions on the sparsity and noise level of the
  feature vectors, a carefully designed two-layer graph neural network can, with high
  probability, recover the correct mapping between the vertices with the help of the
  graph structure. Additionally, we prove that our condition on the noise parameter
  is tight up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we compare the performance of the graph
  neural network to directly solving an assignment problem using the noisy vertex
  features and demonstrate that when the noise level is at least constant, this direct
  matching fails to achieve perfect recovery, whereas the graph neural network can
  tolerate noise levels growing as fast as a power of the size of the graph. Our theoretical
  findings are further supported by numerical studies as well as real-world data experiments.
