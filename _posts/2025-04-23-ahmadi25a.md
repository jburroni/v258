abstract: " We initiate the study of a new notion of adversarial loss which we call
  distributional adversarial loss. In this notion, we assume for each original example,
  the allowed adversarial perturbation set is a family of distributions, and the adversarial
  loss over each example is the maximum loss over all the associated distributions.
  The goal is to minimize the overall adversarial loss. We show sample complexity
  bounds in the PAC-learning setting for our notion of adversarial loss. Our notion
  of adversarial loss contrasts the prior work on robust learning that considers a
  set of points, not distributions, as the perturbation set of each clean example.
  As an application of our approach, we show how to unify the two lines of work on
  randomized smoothing and robust learning in the PAC-learning setting and derive
  sample complexity bounds for randomized smoothing methods. Furthermore, we investigate
  the role of randomness in achieving robustness against adversarial attacks. We show
  a general derandomization technique that preserves the extent of a randomized classifierâ€™s
  robustness against adversarial attacks and show its effectiveness empirically. "
