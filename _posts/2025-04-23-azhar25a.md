title: 'MEDUSA: Medical Data Under Shadow Attacks via Hybrid Model Inversion'
openreview: G1cIU7JqMC
abstract: We introduce MEDUSA (Medical Data Under Shadow Attacks), a novel hybrid
  model inversion framework that leverages gradient-based optimization and TCNNs to
  reconstruct high-fidelity medical images from model outputs in a gray-box setting.
  Unlike traditional attacks requiring full model details, MEDUSA uses surrogate shadow
  models trained on publicly available data, simulating limited-information scenarios
  often encountered in practice. Our approach shows that even with restricted access,
  quality image reconstructions are possible, raising serious privacy concerns for
  patient data. Contributions include demonstrating that a combination of gradient-based
  methods and TCNNs yields potent reconstructions, even with limited model access,
  and providing a detailed analysis of how different input configurations impact reconstruction
  quality. We also evaluate the reconstructions as viable training data, finding that
  they can approximate real images well enough to use for model training. Finally,
  we propose robust defensive mechanisms such as output vector truncation, Gaussian
  noise, and a new k-NN smearing technique to tackle privacy risks.
