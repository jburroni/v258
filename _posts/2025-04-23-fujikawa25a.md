title: Harnessing the Power of Vicinity-Informed Analysis for Classification under
  Covariate Shift
software: https://github.com/mdl-tsukuba/vicnity-cov-shift
openreview: 698r7XuT2a
abstract: Transfer learning enhances prediction accuracy on a target distribution
  by leveraging data from a source distribution, demonstrating significant benefits
  in various applications. This paper introduces a novel dissimilarity measure that
  utilizes vicinity information, i.e., the local structure of data points, to analyze
  the excess error in classification under covariate shift, a transfer learning setting
  where marginal feature distributions differ but conditional label distributions
  remain the same. We characterize the excess error using the proposed measure and
  demonstrate faster or competitive convergence rates compared to previous techniques.
  Notably, our approach is effective in the support non-containment assumption, which
  often appears in real-world applications, holds. Our theoretical analysis bridges
  the gap between current theoretical findings and empirical observations in transfer
  learning, particularly in scenarios with significant differences between source
  and target distributions.
