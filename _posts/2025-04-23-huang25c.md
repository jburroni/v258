abstract: " Observational genome-wide association studies are now widely used for
  causal inference in genetic epidemiology. To maintain privacy, such data is often
  only publicly available as summary statistics, and often studies for the endogenous
  covariates and the outcome are available separately. This has necessitated methods
  tailored to two-sample summary statistics. Current state-of-the-art methods modify
  linear instrumental variable (IV) regression—with genetic variants as instruments—to
  account for unmeasured confounding. However, since the endogenous covariates can
  be high dimensional, standard IV assumptions are generally insufficient to identify
  all causal effects simultaneously. We ensure identifiability by assuming the causal
  effects are sparse and propose a sparse causal effect two-sample IV estimator, spaceTSIV,
  adapting the spaceIV estimator by Pfister and Peters (2022) for two-sample summary
  statistics. We provide two methods, based on L0- and L1-penalization, respectively.
  We prove identifiability of the sparse causal effects in the two-sample setting
  and consistency of spaceTSIV. The performance of spaceTSIV is compared with existing
  two-sample IV methods in simulations. Finally, we showcase our methods using real
  proteomic and gene-expression data for drug-target discovery. "
