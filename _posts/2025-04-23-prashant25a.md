title: Scalable Out-of-Distribution Robustness in the Presence of Unobserved Confounders
software: https://github.com/parjanya20/ScalableOOD/
openreview: eIyOtZ9tgl
abstract: 'We consider the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, where
  the distribution shift is due to an unobserved confounder ($Z$) affecting both the
  covariates ($X$) and the labels ($Y$). This confounding introduces heterogeneity
  in the predictor, i.e., $P(Y \mid X) = E_{P(Z \mid X)}[P(Y \mid X,Z)]$, making traditional
  covariate and label shift assumptions unsuitable. OOD generalization differs from
  traditional domain adaptation in that it does not assume access to the covariate
  distribution ($X^\text{te}$) of the test samples during training. These conditions
  create a challenging scenario for OOD robustness: (a) $Z^\text{tr}$ is an unobserved
  confounder during training, (b) $P^\text{te}(Z) \neq P^\text{tr}(Z)$, (c) $X^\text{te}$
  is unavailable during training, and (d) the predictive distribution depends on $P^\text{te}(Z)$.
  While prior work has developed complex predictors requiring multiple additional
  variables for identifiability of the latent distribution, we explore a set of identifiability
  assumptions that yield a surprisingly simple predictor using only a single additional
  variable. Our approach demonstrates superior empirical performance on several benchmark
  tasks.'
