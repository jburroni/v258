abstract: " Equivariant neural networks have shown great success in reinforcement
  learning, improving sample efficiency and generalization when there is symmetry
  in the task. However, in many problems, only approximate symmetry is present, which
  makes imposing exact symmetry inappropriate. Recently, approximately equivariant
  networks have been proposed for supervised classification and modeling physical
  systems. In this work, we develop approximately equivariant algorithms in reinforcement
  learning (RL). We define approximately equivariant MDPs and theoretically characterize
  the effect of approximate equivariance on the optimal Q function. We propose novel
  RL architectures using relaxed group and steerable convolutions and experiment on
  several continuous control domains and stock trading with real financial data. Our
  results demonstrate that the approximately equivariant network performs on par with
  exactly equivariant networks when exact symmetries are present, and outperforms
  them when the domains exhibit approximate symmetry. As an added byproduct of these
  techniques, we observe increased robustness to noise at test time. Our code is available
