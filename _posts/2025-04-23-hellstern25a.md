abstract: " Spectral networks derived from multivariate time series data arise in
  many domains, from brain science to Earth science. Often, it is of interest to study
  how these networks change under different conditions. For instance, to better understand
  epilepsy, it would be interesting to capture the changes in the brain connectivity
  network as a patient experiences a seizure, using electroencephalography data. A
  common approach relies on estimating the networks in each condition and calculating
  their difference. Such estimates may behave poorly in high dimensions as the networks
  themselves may not be sparse in structure while their difference may be. We build
  upon this observation to develop an estimator of the difference in inverse spectral
  densities across two conditions. Using an l1 penalty on the difference, consistency
  is established by only requiring the difference to be sparse. We illustrate the
  method on synthetic data experiments and on experiments with electroencephalography
  data. "
