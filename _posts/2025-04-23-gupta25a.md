title: " On the Inherent Privacy of Zeroth-Order Projected Gradient Descent "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=6h1KG7f0yn "
abstract: " Differentially private zeroth-order optimization methods have recently
  gained popularity in private fine tuning of machine learning models due to their
  reduced memory requirements. Current approaches for privatizing zeroth-order methods
  rely on adding Gaussian noise to the estimated zeroth-order gradients. However,
  since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently random, researchers
  including Tang et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2024a) have raised an important question:
  is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators sufficient to ensure the overall
  differential privacy of the algorithm? This work settles this question for a class
  of oracle-based optimization algorithms where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient
  estimates. In particular, we show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly
  convex objective functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent
  (ZO-GD) is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random
  initialization and without revealing intermediate iterates, the privacy loss in
  ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when minimizing convex
  objective functions. "
