title: Noise-Aware Differentially Private Variational Inference
software: https://github.com/DPBayes/noise-aware-dpvi
openreview: mkzKiQodnz
abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides robust privacy guarantees for statistical
  inference, but this can lead to unreliable results and biases in downstream applications.
  While several noise-aware approaches have been proposed which integrate DP perturbation
  into the inference, they are limited to specific types of simple probabilistic models.
  In this work, we propose a novel method for noise-aware approximate Bayesian inference
  based on stochastic gradient variational inference which can also be applied to
  high-dimensional and non-conjugate models. We also propose a more accurate evaluation
  method for noise-aware posteriors. Empirically, our inference method has similar
  performance to existing methods in the domain where they are applicable. Outside
  this domain, we obtain accurate coverages on high-dimensional Bayesian linear regression
  and well-calibrated predictive probabilities on Bayesian logistic regression with
  the UCI Adult dataset.
