title: Distributional Counterfactual Explanations With Optimal Transport
software: https://github.com/youlei202/distributional-counterfactual-explanation
openreview: cGnnwEm2gu
abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CE) are the de facto method for providing insights
  into black-box decision-making models by identifying alternative inputs that lead
  to different outcomes. However, existing CE approaches, including group and global
  methods, focus predominantly on specific input modifications, lacking the ability
  to capture nuanced distributional characteristics that influence model outcomes
  across the entire input-output spectrum. This paper proposes distributional counterfactual
  explanation (DCE), shifting focus to the distributional properties of observed and
  counterfactual data, thus providing broader insights. DCE is particularly beneficial
  for stakeholders making strategic decisions based on statistical data analysis,
  as it makes the statistical distribution of the counterfactual resembles the one
  of the factual when aligning model outputs with a target distributionâ€”something
  that the existing CE methods cannot fully achieve. We leverage optimal transport
  (OT) to formulate a chance-constrained optimization problem, deriving a counterfactual
  distribution aligned with its factual counterpart, supported by statistical confidence.
  The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through experiments, highlighting
  its potential to provide deeper insights into decision-making models.
