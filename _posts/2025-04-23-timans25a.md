title: 'Max-Rank: Efficient Multiple Testing for Conformal Prediction'
software: https://github.com/alextimans/max-rank
openreview: 1YicSQLwjR
abstract: Multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) frequently arises in scientific inquiries,
  and concurrent testing of multiple hypotheses inflates the risk of Type-I errors
  or false positives, rendering MHT corrections essential. This paper addresses MHT
  in the context of conformal prediction, a flexible framework for predictive uncertainty
  quantification. Some conformal applications give rise to simultaneous testing, and
  positive dependencies among tests typically exist. We introduce max-rank, a novel
  correction that exploits these dependencies whilst efficiently controlling the family-wise
  error rate. Inspired by existing permutation-based corrections, max-rank leverages
  rank order information to improve performance and integrates readily with any conformal
  procedure. We establish its theoretical and empirical advantages over the common
  Bonferroni correction and its compatibility with conformal prediction, highlighting
  the potential to strengthen predictive uncertainty estimates.
