abstract: " Assessing the accuracy of the output of causal discovery algorithms is
  crucial in developing and comparing novel methods. Common evaluation metrics such
  as the structural Hamming distance are useful for assessing individual links of
  causal graphs. However, many state-of-the-art causal discovery methods do not output
  single causal graphs, but rather their Markov equivalence classes (MECs) which encode
  all of the graphâ€™s separation and connection statements. In this work, we propose
  additional measures of distance that capture the difference in separations of two
  causal graphs which link-based distances are not fit to assess. The proposed distances
  have low polynomial time complexity and are applicable to directed acyclic graphs
  (DAGs) as well as to maximal ancestral graph (MAGs) that may contain bidirected
  edges. We complement our theoretical analysis with toy examples and empirical experiments
  that highlight the differences to existing comparison metrics. "
