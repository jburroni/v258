title: Statistical Inference for Feature Selection after Optimal Transport-based Domain
  Adaptation
software: https://github.com/NT-Loi/SFS_DA
openreview: aNkzzq4clD
abstract: Feature Selection (FS) under domain adaptation (DA) is a critical task in
  machine learning, especially when dealing with limited target data. However, existing
  methods lack the capability to guarantee the reliability of FS under DA. In this
  paper, we introduce a novel statistical method to statistically test FS reliability
  under DA, named SFS-DA (statistical FS-DA). The key strength of SFS-DA lies in its
  ability to control the false positive rate (FPR) below a pre-specified level $\alpha$
  (e.g., 0.05) while maximizing the true positive rate. Compared to the literature
  on statistical FS, SFS-DA presents a unique challenge in addressing the effect of
  DA to ensure the validity of the inference on FS results. We overcome this challenge
  by leveraging the Selective Inference (SI) framework. Specifically, by carefully
  examining the FS process under DA whose operations can be characterized by linear
  and quadratic inequalities, we prove that achieving FPR control in SFS-DA is indeed
  possible. Furthermore, we enhance the true detection rate by introducing a more
  strategic approach. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets
  robustly support our theoretical results, showcasing the SFS-DAâ€™s superior performance.
