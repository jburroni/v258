abstract: " Mitigating shortcuts, where models exploit spurious correlations in training
  data, remains a significant challenge for improving generalization. Regularization
  methods have been proposed to address this issue by enhancing model generalizability.
  However, we demonstrate that these methods can sometimes overregularize, inadvertently
  suppressing causal features along with spurious ones. In this work, we analyze the
  theoretical mechanisms by which regularization mitigates shortcuts and explore the
  limits of its effectiveness. Additionally, we identify the conditions under which
  regularization can successfully eliminate shortcuts without compromising causal
  features. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, our comprehensive
  analysis provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of regularization
  techniques for addressing shortcuts, offering guidance for developing more robust
  models. "
