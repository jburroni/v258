abstract: " Analyzing the structure of sampled features from an input data distribution
  is challenging when constrained by limited measurements in both the number of inputs
  and features. Traditional approaches often rely on the eigenvalue spectrum of the
  sample covariance matrix derived from finite measurement matrices; however, these
  spectra are sensitive to the size of the measurement matrix, leading to biased insights.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm that provides unbiased estimates of
  the spectral moments of the kernel integral operator in the limit of infinite inputs
  and features from finitely sampled measurement matrices. Our method, based on dynamic
  programming, is efficient and capable of estimating the moments of the operator
  spectrum. We demonstrate the accuracy of our estimator on radial basis function
  (RBF) kernels, highlighting its consistency with the theoretical spectra. Furthermore,
  we showcase the practical utility and robustness of our method in understanding
  the geometry of learned representations in neural networks. "
