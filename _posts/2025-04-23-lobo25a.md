abstract: " Supervised learning with missing data aims at building the best prediction
  of a target output based on partially-observed inputs. Major approaches to address
  this problem  can be decomposed into $(i)$ impute-then-predict strategies, which
  first fill in the empty input components and then apply a unique predictor and $(ii)$
  Pattern-by-Pattern (P-b-P) approaches, where a predictor is built on each missing
  pattern. In this paper, we theoretically analyze how three classical linear classifiers,
  namely perceptron, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), behave
  with Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) data, depending on the strategy (imputation
  or P-b-P) to handle missing values. We prove that both imputation and P-b-P approaches
  are ill-specified in a logistic regression framework, thus questioning the relevance
  of such approaches to handle missing data. The most favorable auspices to perform
  classification with missing data concern P-b-P LDA methods. We provide finite-sample
  bounds for the excess risk in this framework, even for high-dimensional settings
  or MNAR data. Experiments illustrate our theoretical findings. "
