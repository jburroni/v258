title: Stochastic Weight Sharing for Bayesian Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/moulelin/2DGBNN
openreview: N5dLFZhu7U
abstract: While offering a principled framework for uncertainty quantification in
  deep learning, the employment of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) is still constrained
  by their increased computational requirements and the convergence difficulties when
  training very deep, state-of-the-art architectures. In this work, We reinterpret
  weight-sharing quantization techniques from a stochastic perspective in the context
  of training and inference with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Specifically, we
  leverage 2D-adaptive Gaussian distributions, Wasserstein distance estimations, and
  alpha-blending to encode the stochastic behavior of a BNN in a lower-dimensional,
  soft Gaussian representation. Through extensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate
  that our approach significantly reduces the computational overhead inherent in Bayesian
  learning by several orders of magnitude, enabling efficient Bayesian training of
  large-scale models, such as ResNet-101 and Vision Transformer (VIT). On various
  computer vision benchmarks—including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet1k—our approach
  compresses model parameters by approximately 50$\times$ and reduces model size by
  75% while achieving accuracy and uncertainty estimations comparable to state-of-the-art.
