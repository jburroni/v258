title: Constrained Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization through Optimistic Constraints
  Estimation

openreview: BErNKnkpDn
abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization has been widely adopted in scientific
  experiment design, including drug discovery and hyperparameter optimization. In
  practice, regulatory or safety concerns often impose additional thresholds on certain
  attributes of the experimental outcomes. Previous work has primarily focused on
  constrained single-objective optimization tasks or active search under constraints.
  The existing constrained multi-objective algorithms address the issue with heuristics
  and approximations, posing challenges to the analysis of the sample efficiency.
  We propose a novel constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm \textbf{COMBOO}
  that balances active learning of the level-set defined on multiple unknowns with
  multi-objective optimization within the feasible region. We provide both theoretical
  analysis and empirical evidence, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach on various
  synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications.
