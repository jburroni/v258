abstract: Traditional molecule generation methods often rely on sequence- or graph-based
  representations, which can limit their expressive power or require complex permutation-equivariant
  architectures. This paper introduces a novel paradigm for learning molecule generative
  models based on functional representations. Specifically, we propose Molecular Implicit
  Neural Generation (MING), a diffusion-based model that learns molecular distributions
  in the function space. Unlike standard diffusion processes in the data space, MING
  employs a novel functional denoising probabilistic process, which jointly denoises
  information in both the function’s input and output spaces by leveraging an expectation-maximization
  procedure for latent implicit neural representations of data. This approach enables
  a simple yet effective model design that accurately captures underlying function
  distributions. Experimental results on molecule-related datasets demonstrate MING’s
  superior performance and ability to generate plausible molecular samples, surpassing
  state-of-the-art data-space methods while offering a more streamlined architecture
  and significantly faster generation times. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/v18nguye/MING.}
