title: 'Survival Models: Proper Scoring Rule and Stochastic Optimization with Competing
  Risks'
software: https://github.com/soda-inria/hazardous/tree/main
openreview: 98VGlF621z
abstract: 'When dealing with right-censored data, where some outcomes are missing
  due to a limited observation period, survival analysis —known as \emph{time-to-event
  analysis}— focuses on predicting the time until an event of interest occurs. Multiple
  classes of outcomes lead to a classification variant: predicting the most likely
  event, a less explored area known as \emph{competing risks}. Classic competing risks
  models couple architecture and loss, limiting scalability.  To address these issues,
  we design a strictly proper censoring-adjusted separable scoring rule, allowing
  optimization on a subset of the data as each observation is evaluated independently.
  The loss estimates outcome probabilities and enables stochastic optimization for
  competing risks, which we use for efficient gradient boosting trees. \textbf{SurvivalBoost}
  not only outperforms 12 state-of-the-art models across several metrics on 4 real-life
  datasets, both in competing risks and survival settings, but also provides great
  calibration, the ability to predict across any time horizon, and computation times
  faster than existing methods.'
