abstract: " This work investigates adversarial training in the context of margin-based
  linear classifiers in the high-dimensional regime where the dimension  $d$ and the
  number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\\alpha = n / d$.  We introduce
  a tractable mathematical model where the interplay between the data and adversarial
  attacker geometries can be studied, while capturing the core phenomenology observed
  in the adversarial robustness literature.  Our main theoretical contribution is
  an exact asymptotic description of the sufficient statistics for the adversarial
  empirical risk minimiser, under generic convex and non-increasing losses for a Block
  Feature Model.  Our result allow us to precisely characterise which directions in
  the data are associated with a higher generalisation/robustness trade-off, as defined
  by a robustness and a usefulness metric.  This goes beyond previous models in the
  literature, which fail to capture a difference in performance between adversarially
  trained models in the high sample complexity regime. In particular, we unveil the
  existence of directions which can be defended without penalising accuracy.  Finally,
  we show the advantage of defending non-robust features during training, identifying
  a uniform protection as an inherently effective defence mechanism. "
