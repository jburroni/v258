title: A Shapley-value Guided Rationale Editor for Rationale Learning
software: https://github.com/zixinK/SHARE
openreview: R89NsFVgV5
abstract: Rationale learning aims to automatically uncover the underlying explanations
  for NLP predictions. Previous studies in rationale learning mainly focus on the
  relevance of independent tokens with the predictions without considering their marginal
  contribution and the collective readability of extracted rationales. Through an
  empirical analysis, we argue that the sufficiency, informativeness, and readability
  of rationales are essential for explaining diverse end-task predictions. Accordingly,
  we propose Shapley-value Guided Rationale Editor (SHARE), an unsupervised approach
  that refines editable rationales while predicting task outcomes. SHARE extracts
  a sequence of tokens as a rationale, providing a collective explanation that is
  sufficient, informative, and readable. SHARE is highly adaptable for tasks like
  sentiment analysis, claim verification, and question answering, and can integrate
  seamlessly with various language models to provide explainability. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing sufficiency, informativeness, and readability
  across diverse applications. Our code and datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/zixinK/SHARE.}
