title: Score matching for bridges without learning time-reversals
software: https://github.com/libbylbaker/forward_bridge
openreview: wkLO3Q1it8
abstract: We propose a new algorithm for learning a bridged diffusion process using
  score-matching methods.  Our method relies on reversing the dynamics of the forward
  process and using this to learn a score function, which, via Doobâ€™s $h$-transform,
  gives us a bridged diffusion process; that is, a process conditioned on an endpoint.  In
  contrast to prior methods, ours learns the score term $\nabla_x \log p(t, x; T,
  y)$, for given $t, y$ directly, completely avoiding the need for first learning
  a time-reversal.  We compare the performance of our algorithm with existing methods
  and see that it outperforms using the (learned) time-reversals to learn the score
  term. The code can be found at \url{https://github.com/libbylbaker/forward_bridge.}
