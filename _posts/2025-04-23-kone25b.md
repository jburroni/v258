abstract: " We study the Pareto Set Identification (PSI) problem in a structured multi-output
  linear bandit model. In this setting, each arm is associated a feature vector belonging
  to $\\mathbb{R}^h$ and its mean vector in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ linearly depends on this
  feature vector through a common unknown matrix $\\Theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h \\times
  d}$. The goal is to identify the set of non-dominated arms by adaptively collecting
  samples from the arms. We introduce and analyze the first optimal design-based algorithms
  for PSI, providing nearly optimal guarantees in both the fixed-budget and the fixed-confidence
  settings. Notably, we show that the difficulty of these tasks mainly depends on
  the sub-optimality gaps of $h$ arms only.  Our theoretical results are supported
  by an extensive benchmark on synthetic and real-world datasets. "
