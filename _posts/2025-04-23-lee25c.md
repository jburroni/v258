title: " Q-function Decomposition with Intervention Semantics for Factored Action
  Spaces "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=76DLXLgWwP "
abstract: " Many practical reinforcement learning environments have a discrete factored
  action space that induces a large combinatorial set of actions, thereby posing significant
  challenges.  Existing approaches leverage the regular structure of the action space
  and resort to a linear decomposition of Q-functions, which avoids enumerating all
  combinations of factored actions.  In this paper,  we consider Q-functions defined
  over a lower dimensional projected subspace of the original action space, and study
  the condition for the unbiasedness of decomposed Q-functions using causal effect
  estimation from the no unobserved confounder setting in causal statistics.  This
  leads to a general scheme which we call action decomposed reinforcement learning
  that uses the projected Q-functions to approximate the Q-function in standard model-free
  reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed approach is shown to improve sample
  complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate improvements
  in sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines in online continuous
  control environments and a real-world offline sepsis treatment environment. "
