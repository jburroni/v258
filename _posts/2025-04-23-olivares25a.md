title: Clustering Context in Off-Policy Evaluation
software: https://github.com/amazon-science/ope-cluster-context
openreview: HhhPwHNk6u
abstract: Off-policy evaluation can leverage logged data to estimate the effectiveness
  of new policies in e-commerce, search engines, media streaming services, or automatic
  diagnostic tools in healthcare. However, the performance of baseline off-policy
  estimators like IPS deteriorates when the logging policy significantly differs from
  the evaluation policy. Recent work proposes sharing information across similar actions
  to mitigate this problem. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator that
  shares information across similar contexts using clustering. We study the theoretical
  properties of the proposed estimator, characterizing its bias and variance under
  different conditions. We also compare the performance of the proposed estimator
  and existing approaches in various synthetic problems, as well as a real-world recommendation
  dataset. Our experimental results confirm that clustering contexts improves estimation
  accuracy, especially in deficient information settings.
