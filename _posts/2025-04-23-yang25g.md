abstract: " Bilevel reinforcement learning (RL), which features intertwined two-level
  problems, has attracted growing interest recently. The inherent non-convexity of
  the lower-level RL problem is, however, to be an impediment to developing bilevel
  optimization methods. By employing the fixed point equation associated with the
  regularized RL, we characterize the hyper-gradient via fully first-order information,
  thus circumventing the assumption of lower-level convexity. This, remarkably, distinguishes
  our development of hyper-gradient from the general AID-based bilevel frameworks
  since we take advantage of the specific structure of RL problems. Moreover, we design
  both model-based and model-free bilevel reinforcement learning algorithms, facilitated
  by access to the fully first-order hyper-gradient. Both algorithms enjoy the convergence
  rate $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$. To extend the applicability, a
  stochastic version of the model-free algorithm is proposed, along with results on
  its convergence rate and sampling complexity. In addition, numerical experiments
  demonstrate that the hyper-gradient indeed serves as an integration of exploitation
  and exploration. "
