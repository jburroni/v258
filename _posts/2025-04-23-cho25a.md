abstract: In multi-armed bandits, reward maximization and pure exploration are often
  at odds with each other. The former focuses on exploiting arms with the highest
  means, while the latter may require constant exploration across all arms. In this
  work, we focus on good arm identification (GAI), a pure exploration objective that
  aims to label arms with means above a threshold as quickly as possible. We show
  that GAI can be efficiently solved by combining a reward-maximizing sampling algorithm
  with a novel nonparametric anytime-valid sequential test for labeling arm means.
  We begin by presenting the theoretical guarantees of our proposed sequential test.
  Under nonparametric assumptions, our test ensures strict error control and asymptotically
  achieves the minimax optimal e-power, a notion of power for anytime-valid tests.
  Building on this, we propose an algorithm for GAI by pairing regret-minimizing sampling
  schemes with our sequential test as a stopping criterion. We show that this approach
  achieves minimax optimal stopping times for labeling arms with means above a threshold,
  under an error probability constraint $\delta$. Our empirical results validate our
  approach beyond the minimax setting, reducing the expected number of samples for
  all stopping times by at least 50% across both synthetic and real-world settings.
