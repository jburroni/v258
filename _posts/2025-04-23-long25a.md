abstract: " Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is  a powerful and popular operator learning
  method. However, FNO is mainly used in forward prediction, yet a great many applications
  rely on solving inverse problems. In this paper, we propose an invertible Fourier
  Neural Operator (iFNO) for jointly tackling the forward and inverse problems. We
  developed a series of invertible Fourier blocks in the latent channel space to share
  the model parameters, exchange the information, and mutually regularize the learning
  for the bi-directional tasks. We integrated a variational auto-encoder to capture
  the intrinsic structures within the input space and to enable posterior inference
  so as to mitigate challenges of illposedness, data shortage, noises that are common
  in inverse problems. We proposed a three-step process to combine the invertible
  blocks and the VAE component for effective training. The evaluations on seven benchmark
  forward and inverse tasks have demonstrated the advantages of our approach. The
  code is available at \\url{https://github.com/BayesianAIGroup/iFNO.} "
