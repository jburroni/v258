title: Steering No-Regret Agents in MFGs under Model Uncertainty
openreview: 8RkuhtbH0H
abstract: Incentive design is a popular framework for guiding agents’ learning dynamics
  towards desired outcomes by providing additional payments beyond intrinsic rewards.
  However, most existing works focus on a finite, small set of agents or assume complete
  knowledge of the game, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios involving
  large populations and model uncertainty. To address this gap, we study the design
  of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with density-independent transitions,
  where both the transition dynamics and intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This
  setting presents non-trivial challenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents
  to explore for its model learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer
  them to converge to desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments.
  Assuming agents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic
  exploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret guarantees
  for the cumulative gaps between the agents’ behaviors and the desired ones. In terms
  of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total incentive payments incur only
  sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline steering strategy that stabilizes the
  target policy as an equilibrium. Our work presents an effective framework for steering
  agents behaviors in large-population systems under uncertainty.
