title: " Distance Estimation for High-Dimensional Discrete Distributions "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=qmZwsWnMi7 "
abstract: " Given two distributions $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ over a high-dimensional
  domain $\\{0,1\\}^n$, and a parameter $\\varepsilon$, the goal of distance estimation
  is to determine the statistical distance between $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$,
  up to an additive tolerance $\\pm \\varepsilon$. Since exponential lower bounds
  (in $n$) are known for the problem in the standard sampling model, research has
  focused on richer query models where one can draw conditional samples. This paper
  presents the first polynomial query distance estimator in the conditional sampling
  model ($\\mathsf{COND}$).  We base our algorithm on the relatively weaker \\textit{subcube
  conditional} sampling ($\\mathsf{SUBCOND}$) oracle, which draws samples from the
  distribution conditioned on some of the dimensions. $\\mathsf{SUBCOND}$ is a promising
  model for widespread practical use because it captures the natural behavior of discrete
  samplers. Our algorithm makes $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^3/\\varepsilon^5)$ queries
  to $\\mathsf{SUBCOND}$. "
