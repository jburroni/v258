abstract: " Bayesian inference is widely used in practice due to its ability to assess
  epistemic uncertainty (EU) in predictions. However, its computational complexity
  necessitates the use of approximation methods, such as variational inference (VI).
  When estimating EU within the VI framework, metrics such as the variance of the
  posterior predictive distribution and conditional mutual information are commonly
  employed. Despite their practical importance, these metrics lack comprehensive theoretical
  analysis. In this paper, we investigate these EU metrics by providing their novel
  relationship to excess risk, which allows for a convergence analysis based on PAC-Bayesian
  theory. Based on these analyses, we then demonstrate that some existing objective
  functions of VI  regularize EU metrics in different ways leading to different performance
  in EU evaluation. Finally, we propose a novel objective function for VI that directly
  optimizes both prediction and EU under the PAC-Bayesian framework. Experimental
  results indicate that our algorithm significantly improves EU estimation compared
  to existing VI methods. "
