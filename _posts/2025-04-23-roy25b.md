abstract: High dimensional sparse linear bandits serve as an efficient model for sequential
  decision-making problems (e.g. personalized medicine), where high dimensional features
  (e.g. genomic data) on the users are available, but only a small subset of them
  are relevant. Motivated by data privacy concerns in these applications, we study
  the joint differentially private high dimensional sparse linear bandits, where both
  rewards and contexts are considered as private data. First, to quantify the cost
  of privacy, we derive a lower bound on the regret achievable in this setting. To
  further address the problem, we design a computationally efficient bandit algorithm,
  \textbf{F}orgetfu\textbf{L} \textbf{I}terative \textbf{P}rivate \textbf{HA}rd \textbf{T}hresholding
  (FLIPHAT). Along with doubling of episodes and episodic forgetting, FLIPHAT deploys
  a variant of Noisy Iterative Hard Thresholding (N-IHT) algorithm as a sparse linear
  regression oracle to ensure both privacy and regret-optimality. We show that FLIPHAT
  achieves optimal regret in terms of privacy parameters, context dimension, and time
  horizon up to a linear factor in model sparsity in the problem independent case.
  We analyze the regret by providing a novel refined analysis of the estimation error
  of N-IHT, which is of parallel interest.
