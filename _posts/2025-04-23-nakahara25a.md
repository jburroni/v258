abstract: " Deterministic decision trees have difficulty in evaluating uncertainty
  especially for small samples. To solve this problem, we interpret the decision trees
  as stochastic models and consider prediction problems in the framework of Bayesian
  decision theory. Our models have three kinds of parameters: a tree shape, leaf parameters,
  and inner parameters. To make Bayesian optimal decisions, we have to calculate the
  posterior distribution of these parameters. Previously, two types of methods have
  been proposed. One marginalizes out the leaf parameters and samples the tree shape
  and the inner parameters by Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms. The other marginalizes
  out both the leaf parameters and the tree shape based on a concept called meta-trees
  and approximates the posterior distribution for the inner parameters by a bagging-like
  method. In this paper, we propose a novel MH algorithm where the leaf parameters
  and the tree shape are marginalized out by using the meta-trees and only the inner
  parameters are sampled. Moreover, we update all the inner parameters simultaneously
  in each MH step. This algorithm accelerates the convergence and mixing of the Markov
  chain. We evaluate our algorithm on various benchmark datasets with other state-of-the-art
  methods. Further, our model provides a novel statistical evaluation of feature importance. "
