abstract: " Multi-objective optimization aims to find a set of solutions that achieve
  the best trade-off among multiple conflicting objective functions. While various
  multi-objective optimization algorithms have been proposed so far, most of them
  aim to find finite solutions as an approximation of the Pareto set, which may not
  adequately capture the entire structure of the Pareto set, especially when the number
  of variables is large. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method to obtain
  a parametric hypersurface representing the entire Pareto set instead of a finite
  set of points. Since the Pareto set of an $M$-objective optimization problem typically
  forms an $(M-1)$-dimensional simplex, we use a B{é}zier simplex as a model to express
  the Pareto set. We then develop a stochastic gradient descent-based algorithm that
  updates the B{é}zier simplex model toward the Pareto set, introducing a preconditioning
  matrix to enhance convergence. Our convergence analysis demonstrated that the proposed
  algorithm outperforms naive stochastic gradient descent in terms of convergence
  rate. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our method through various multi-objective
  optimization problem instances, including real-world problems. "
