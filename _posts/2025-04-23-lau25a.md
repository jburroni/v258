abstract: " The Local Learning Coefficient (LLC) is introduced as a novel complexity
  measure for deep neural networks (DNNs). Recognizing the limitations of traditional
  complexity measures, the LLC leverages Singular Learning Theory (SLT), which has
  long recognized the significance of singularities in the loss landscape geometry.
  This paper provides an extensive exploration of the LLC’s theoretical underpinnings,
  offering both a clear definition and intuitive insights into its application. Moreover,
  we propose a new scalable estimator for the LLC, which is then effectively applied
  across diverse architectures including deep linear networks up to 100M parameters,
  ResNet image models, and transformer language models. Empirical evidence suggests
  that the LLC provides valuable insights into how training heuristics might influence
  the effective complexity of DNNs. Ultimately, the LLC emerges as a crucial tool
  for reconciling the apparent contradiction between deep learning’s complexity and
  the principle of parsimony. "
