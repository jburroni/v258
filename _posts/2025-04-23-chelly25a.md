abstract: " Neural models for amortized probabilistic clustering yield samples of
  cluster labels given a set-structured input, while avoiding lengthy Markov chain
  runs and the need for explicit data likelihoods. Existing methods which label each
  data point sequentially, like the Neural Clustering Process, often lead to cluster
  assignments highly dependent on the data order. Alternatively, methods that sequentially
  create full clusters, do not provide assignment probabilities. In this paper, we
  introduce GFNCP, a novel framework for  amortized clustering. GFNCP is formulated
  as a Generative Flow Network with a shared energy-based parametrization of policy
  and reward. We show that the flow matching conditions are equivalent to consistency
  of the clustering posterior under marginalization, which in turn implies order invariance.
  GFNCP also outperforms existing methods in clustering performance on both synthetic
  and real-world data. "
