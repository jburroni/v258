abstract: " We propose a family of Gaussian processes (GP) for dynamical systems with
  linear time-invariant responses, which are nonlinear only in initial conditions.
  This linearity allows us to tractably quantify forecasting and representational
  uncertainty, simultaneously alleviating the challenge of computing the distribution
  of trajectories from a GP-based dynamical system and enabling a new probabilistic
  treatment of learning Koopman operator representations. Using a trajectory-based
  equivariance – which we refer to as Koopman equivariance – we obtain a  GP model
  with enhanced generalization capabilities. To allow for large-scale regression,
  we equip our framework with variational inference based on suitable inducing points.
  Experiments demonstrate on-par and often better forecasting performance compared
  to kernel-based methods for learning dynamical systems. "
