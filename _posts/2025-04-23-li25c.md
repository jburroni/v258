title: " Towards a mathematical theory for consistency training in diffusion models "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=SVkYxDYnJK "
abstract: " Consistency models, which were proposed to mitigate the high computational
  overhead during the sampling phase of diffusion models, facilitate single-step sampling
  while attaining state-of-the-art empirical performance. When integrated into the
  training phase, consistency models attempt to train a sequence of consistency functions
  capable of mapping any point at any time step of the diffusion process to its starting
  point. Despite the empirical success, a comprehensive theoretical understanding
  of consistency training remains elusive. This paper takes a first step towards establishing
  theoretical underpinnings for consistency models. We demonstrate that, in order
  to generate samples within $\\varepsilon$ proximity to the target in distribution
  (measured by some Wasserstein metric), it suffices for the number of steps in consistency
  learning to exceed the order of $d^{5/2}/\\varepsilon$, with $d$ the data dimension.
  Our theory offers rigorous insights into the validity and efficacy of consistency
  models, illuminating their utility in downstream inference tasks. "
