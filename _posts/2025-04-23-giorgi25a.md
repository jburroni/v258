title: Natural Language Counterfactual Explanations for Graphs Using Large Language
  Models
software: https://github.com/flaat/llm-graph-cf
openreview: bLiWzjcG1W
abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical area
  of research to unravel the opaque inner logic of (deep) machine learning models.  Among
  the various XAI techniques proposed in the literature, counterfactual explanations
  stand out as one of the most promising approaches. However, these “what-if” explanations
  are frequently complex and technical, making them difficult for non-experts to understand
  and, more broadly, challenging for humans to interpret. To bridge this gap, in this
  work, we exploit the power of open-source Large Language Models to generate natural
  language explanations when prompted with valid counterfactual instances produced
  by state-of-the-art explainers for graph-based models.  Experiments across several
  graph datasets and counterfactual explainers show that our approach effectively
  produces accurate natural language representations of counterfactual instances,
  as demonstrated by key performance metrics
