title: On the Consistent Recovery of Joint Distributions from Conditionals
openreview: vkvJDRmOLs
abstract: Self-supervised learning methods that mask parts of the input data and train
  models to predict the missing components have led to significant advances in machine
  learning. These approaches learn conditional distributions $p(x_T \mid x_S)$ simultaneously,
  where $x_S$ and $x_T$ are subsets of the observed variables. In this paper, we examine
  the core problem of when all these conditional distributions are consistent with
  some joint distribution, and whether common models used in practice can learn consistent
  conditionals. We explore this problem in two settings. First, for the complementary
  conditioning sets where $S \cup T$ is the complete set of variables, we introduce
  the concept of path consistency, a necessary condition for a consistent joint. Second,
  we consider the case where we have access to $p(x_T \mid x_S)$ for all subsets $S$
  and $T$. In this case, we propose the concepts of autoregressive and swap consistency,
  which we show are necessary and sufficient conditions for a consistent joint. For
  both settings, we analyze when these consistency conditions hold and show that standard
  discriminative models \emph{may fail to satisfy them}. Finally, we corroborate via
  experiments that proposed consistency measures can be used as proxies for evaluating
  the consistency of conditionals $p(x_T \mid x_S)$, and common parameterizations
  may find it hard to learn true conditionals.
