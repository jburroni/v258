title: An Empirical Bernstein Inequality for Dependent Data in Hilbert Spaces and
  Applications

abstract: Learning from non-independent and non-identically distributed data poses
  a persistent challenge in statistical learning. In this study, we introduce data-dependent
  Bernstein inequalities tailored for vector-valued processes in Hilbert space. Our
  inequalities apply to both  stationary and non-stationary processes and exploit
  the potential rapid decay of correlations between temporally separated variables
  to improve estimation. We demonstrate the utility of these bounds by applying them
  to covariance operator estimation in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and to operator learning
  in dynamical systems, achieving novel risk bounds.  Finally, we perform numerical
  experiments to illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.
