title: Disentangling Interactions and Dependencies in Feature Attributions
software: https://github.com/gcskoenig/aistats_2025_DIP
openreview: BxniFq6TRd
abstract: 'In explainable machine learning, global feature importance methods try
  to determine how much each individual feature contributes to predicting the target
  variable, resulting in one importance score for each feature. But often, predicting
  the target variable requires interactions between several features (such as in the
  XOR function), and features might have complex statistical dependencies that allow
  to partially replace one feature with another one. In commonly used feature importance
  scores, these cooperative effects are conflated with the features’ individual contributions,
  making them prone to misinterpretations.  In this work, we derive DIP, a new mathematical
  decomposition of individual feature importance scores that disentangles three components:
  the standalone contribution and the contributions stemming from interactions and
  dependencies. We prove that the DIP decomposition is unique and show how it can
  be estimated in practice. Based on these results, we propose a new visualization
  of feature importance scores that clearly illustrates the different contributions.'
