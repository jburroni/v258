title: " Exposing Privacy Gaps: Membership Inference Attack on Preference Data for
  LLM Alignment "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=78or9GLOFX "
abstract: " Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their
  remarkable natural language capabilities. However, when deploying them in real-world
  settings, it is important to align LLMs to generate texts according to acceptable
  human standards. Methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference
  Optimization (DPO) have enabled significant progress in refining LLMs using human
  preference data. However, the privacy concerns inherent in utilizing such preference
  data have yet to be adequately studied. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability
  of LLMs aligned using two widely used methods - DPO and PPO - to membership inference
  attacks (MIAs). Our study has two main contributions: first, we theoretically motivate
  that DPO models are more vulnerable to MIA compared to PPO models; second, we introduce
  a novel reference-based attack framework specifically for analyzing preference data
  called PREMIA (Preference data MIA). Using PREMIA and existing baselines we empirically
  show that DPO models have a relatively heightened vulnerability towards MIA. "
