title: Fixed-Budget Change Point Identification in Piecewise Constant Bandits
software: https://github.com/JosephLazzaro/cpi_AISTATS2025
openreview: g8DVAMyn1j
abstract: We study the piecewise constant bandit problem where the expected reward
  is a piecewise constant function with one change point (discontinuity) across the
  action space $[0,1]$ and the learnerâ€™s aim is to locate the change point. Under
  the assumption of a fixed exploration budget, we provide the first non-asymptotic
  analysis of policies designed to locate abrupt changes in the mean reward function
  under bandit feedback. We study the problem under a large and small budget regime,
  and for both settings establish lower bounds on the error probability and provide
  algorithms with near matching upper bounds. Interestingly, our results show a separation
  in the complexity of the two regimes. We then propose a regime adaptive algorithm
  which is near optimal for both small and large budgets simultaneously. We complement
  our theoretical analysis with experimental results in simulated environments to
  support our findings.
