title: Density Ratio-based Proxy Causal Learning Without Density Ratios
software: https://github.com/BariscanBozkurt/Density-Ratio-Based-Proxy-Causal-Learning-without-Density-Ratios
openreview: Qkz4VfG5Df
abstract: 'We address the setting of Proxy Causal Learning (PCL), which has the goal
  of estimating causal effects from observed data in the presence of hidden confounding.
  Proxy methods accomplish this task using two proxy variables related to the latent
  confounder: a treatment proxy (related to the treatment) and an outcome proxy (related
  to the outcome). Two approaches have been proposed to perform causal effect estimation
  given proxy variables; however only one of these has found mainstream acceptance,
  since the other was understood to require density ratio estimation - a challenging
  task in high dimensions. In the present work, we propose a practical and effective
  implementation of the second approach, which bypasses explicit density ratio estimation
  and is suitable for continuous and high-dimensional treatments. We employ kernel
  ridge regression to derive estimators, resulting in simple closed-form solutions
  for dose-response and conditional dose-response curves, along with consistency guarantees.
  Our methods empirically demonstrate superior or comparable performance to existing
  frameworks on synthetic and real-world datasets.'
