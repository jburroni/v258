abstract: The signature kernel is a kernel between time series of arbitrary length
  and comes with strong theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. It has found
  applications in machine learning such as covariance functions for Gaussian processes.
  A strength of the underlying signature features is that they provide a structured
  global description of a time series. However, this property can quickly become a
  curse when local information is essential and forgetting is required; so far this
  has only been addressed with ad-hoc methods such as slicing the time series into
  smaller segments. To overcome this, we propose a principled and data-driven approach
  by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism for signature features. This allows
  the model to dynamically adapt its observed context length to focus on more recent
  information.  To achieve this, we revisit the recently introduced Random Fourier
  Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF)
  with Gaussian processes (GPs). This results in a Bayesian time series forecasting
  algorithm with variational inference, that offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm
  that processes and transforms a time series into a joint predictive distribution
  over the time steps in one pass using recurrence. For example, processing a sequence
  of length $10^4$ steps in less than $10^{-2}$ seconds and in $\approx$ 1GB of GPU
  memory. We demonstrate that the algorithm outperforms other GP-based alternatives
  and competes with state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting algorithms.
