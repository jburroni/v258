title: " All or None: Identifiable Linear Properties of Next-Token Predictors in Language
  Modeling "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=XCmIlemQP5 "
abstract: " We analyze identifiability as a possible explanation for the ubiquity
  of linear properties across language models, such as the vector difference between
  the representations of “easy” and “easiest” being parallel to that between “lucky”
  and “luckiest”. For this, we ask whether finding a linear property in one model
  implies that any model that induces the same distribution has that property, too.
  To answer that, we first prove an identifiability result to characterize distribution-equivalent
  next-token predictors, lifting a diversity requirement of previous results. Second,
  based on a refinement of relational linearity [Paccanaro and Hinton, 2001; Hernandez
  et al., 2024], we show how many notions of linearity are amenable to our analysis.
  Finally, we show that under suitable conditions, these linear properties either
  hold in all or none distribution equivalent next-token predictors. "
