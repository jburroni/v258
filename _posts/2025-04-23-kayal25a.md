abstract: " Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems are being considered under increasingly
  more complex structures. While tabular and linear models have been thoroughly explored,
  the analytical study of RL under non-linear function approximation, especially kernel-based
  models, has recently gained traction for their strong representational capacity
  and theoretical tractability. In this context, we examine the question of statistical
  efficiency in kernel-based RL within the reward-free RL framework, specifically
  asking: how many samples are required to design a near-optimal policy? Existing
  work addresses this question under restrictive assumptions about the class of kernel
  functions. We first explore this question assuming a generative model, then relax
  this assumption at the cost of increasing the sample complexity by a factor of $H$,
  the episode length.  We tackle this fundamental problem using a broad class of kernels
  and a simpler algorithm compared to prior work. Our approach derives new confidence
  intervals for kernel ridge regression, specific to our RL setting, that may be of
  broader applicability. We further validate our theoretical findings through simulations. "
