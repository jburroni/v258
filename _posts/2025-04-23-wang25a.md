abstract: " Graph sparsification is a well-established technique for accelerating
  graph-based learning algorithms, which uses edge sampling to approximate dense graphs
  with sparse ones. Because the sparsification error is random and unknown, users
  must contend with uncertainty about the reliability of downstream computations.
  Although it is possible for users to obtain conceptual guidance from theoretical
  error bounds in the literature, such results are typically impractical at a numerical
  level. Taking an alternative approach, we propose to address these issues from a
  data-driven perspective by computing empirical error estimates. The proposed error
  estimates are highly versatile, and we demonstrate this in four use cases: Laplacian
  matrix approximation, graph cut queries, graph-structured regression, and spectral
  clustering. Moreover, we provide two theoretical guarantees for the error estimates,
  and explain why the cost of computing them is manageable in comparison to the overall
  cost of a typical graph sparsification workflow. "
