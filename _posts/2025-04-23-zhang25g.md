title: Robust Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization with Deep Kernel and Partition
software: https://github.com/SchroDeCat/rMFBO
openreview: yhQKdKSio0
abstract: Multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization (MFBO) is a powerful approach that
  utilizes low-fidelity, cost-effective sources to expedite the exploration and exploitation
  of a high-fidelity objective function. Existing MFBO methods with theoretical foundations
  either lack justification for performance improvements over single-fidelity optimization
  or rely on strong assumptions about the relationships between fidelity sources to
  construct surrogate models and direct queries to low-fidelity sources. To mitigate
  the dependency on cross-fidelity assumptions while maintaining the advantages of
  low-fidelity queries, we introduce a random sampling and partition-based MFBO framework
  with deep kernel learning. This framework is robust to cross-fidelity model misspecification
  and explicitly illustrates the benefits of low-fidelity queries. Our results demonstrate
  that the proposed algorithm effectively manages complex cross-fidelity relationships
  and efficiently optimizes the target fidelity function.
