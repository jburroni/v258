abstract: " In computational physics, machine learning has now emerged as a powerful
  complementary tool to explore efficiently candidate designs in engineering studies.
  Outputs in such supervised problems are signals defined on meshes, and a natural
  question is the extension of general scalar output regression models to such complex
  outputs. Changes between input geometries in terms of both size and adjacency structure
  in particular make this transition non-trivial. In this work, we propose an innovative
  strategy for Gaussian process regression where inputs are large and sparse graphs
  with continuous node attributes and outputs are signals defined on the nodes of
  the associated inputs. The methodology relies on the combination of regularized
  optimal transport, dimension reduction techniques, and the use of Gaussian processes
  indexed by graphs. In addition to enabling signal prediction, the main point of
  our proposal is to come with confidence intervals on node values, which is crucial
  for uncertainty quantification and active learning. Numerical experiments highlight
  the efficiency of the method to solve real problems in fluid dynamics and solid
  mechanics. "
