abstract: " Achieving robust uncertainty quantification for deep neural networks represents
  an important requirement in many real-world applications of deep learning such as
  medical imaging where it is necessary to assess the reliability of a neural networkâ€™s
  prediction. Bayesian neural networks are a promising approach for modeling uncertainties
  in deep neural networks. Unfortunately, generating samples from the posterior distribution
  of neural networks is a major challenge. One significant advance in that direction
  would be the incorporation of adaptive step sizes, similar to modern neural network
  optimizers, into Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling algorithms without significantly
  increasing computational demand. Over the past years, several papers have introduced
  sampling algorithms with corresponding theorems stating that they achieve this property.
  \ In this paper, we demonstrate that these methods can have a substantial bias in
  the distribution they sample, even in the limit of vanishing step sizes and at full
  batch size.  Furthermore, for most of the algorithms, we show that convergence to
  the correct distribution can be restored with a simple fix at the cost of increasing
  computational demand. "
