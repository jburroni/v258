title: 'Revisiting LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD: Improved Rates and Missing Analysis'

openreview: DCt4v3Siky
abstract: LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD are widely used methods in distributed stochastic
  optimization,  with numerous applications in machine learning, large-scale data
  processing, and federated  learning. However, rigorously establishing  their theoretical
  advantages over simpler methods, such as minibatch SGD (MbSGD), has proven challenging,
  as existing analyses often rely on strong assumptions, unrealistic premises, or
  overly restrictive scenarios. In this work, we revisit the convergence properties  of
  LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD under a variety of existing or weaker conditions, including
  gradient similarity,  Hessian similarity, weak convexity, and Lipschitz continuity
  of the Hessian. Our analysis  shows that (i) LocalSGD achieves faster convergence
  compared to MbSGD for weakly convex functions without requiring stronger gradient
  similarity assumptions; (ii) LocalSGD benefits significantly from higher-order similarity  and
  smoothness; and (iii) SCAFFOLD demonstrates faster convergence than MbSGD for a
  broader class of non-quadratic functions. These theoretical insights provide a clearer
  understanding of the conditions under which LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD outperform MbSGD.
