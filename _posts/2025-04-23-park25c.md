title: Semiparametric conformal prediction
software: https://github.com/jiwoncpark/semiparametric-conformal-prediction
openreview: ENscW7Y0lr
abstract: Many risk-sensitive applications require well-calibrated prediction sets
  over multiple, potentially correlated target variables, for which the prediction
  algorithm may report correlated errors. In this work, we aim to construct the conformal
  prediction set accounting for the joint correlation structure of the vector-valued
  non-conformity scores. Drawing from the rich literature on multivariate quantiles
  and semiparametric statistics, we propose an algorithm to estimate the $1-\alpha$
  quantile of the scores, where $\alpha$ is the user-specified miscoverage rate. In
  particular, we flexibly estimate the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF)
  of the scores using nonparametric vine copulas and improve the asymptotic efficiency
  of the quantile estimate using its influence function. The vine decomposition allows
  our method to scale well to a large number of targets. As well as guaranteeing asymptotically
  exact coverage, our method yields desired coverage and competitive efficiency on
  a range of real-world regression problems, including those with missing-at-random
  labels in the calibration set.
