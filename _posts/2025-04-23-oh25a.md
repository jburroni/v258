openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=lblYg0GoCe "
abstract: " Much of science involves discovering and modeling causal relationships
  in nature. Significant progress has been made in developing statistical methods
  for representing and identifying causal knowledge from data using Linear Non-Gaussian
  Acyclic Models (LiNGAMs). Despite successes in learning LiNGAMs across various sample
  settings, the optimal sample complexity for high-dimensional LiNGAMs remains unexplored.
  This study establishes the optimal sample complexity for learning the structure
  of LiNGAMs under a sub-Gaussianity assumption. Specifically, it introduces a structure
  recovery algorithm using distance covariance that achieves the optimal sample complexity,
  $n = \\Theta(d_{in} \\log \\frac{p}{d_{in}})$, without assuming faithfulness or
  a known indegree. The theoretical findings and superiority of the proposed algorithm
  compared to existing algorithms are validated through numerical experiments and
  real data analysis. "
