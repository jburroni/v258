title: Sampling from Bayesian Neural Network Posteriors with Symmetric Minibatch Splitting
  Langevin Dynamics
software: https://github.com/paulindani/SMS_Kinetic_Langevin
openreview: pCwFjmTNyp
abstract: We propose a scalable kinetic Langevin dynamics algorithm for sampling parameter
  spaces of big data and AI applications.  Our scheme combines a symmetric forward/backward
  sweep over minibatches with a symmetric discretization of Langevin dynamics. For
  a particular Langevin splitting method (UBU), we show that the resulting Symmetric
  Minibatch Splitting-UBU (SMS-UBU) integrator has bias $\mathcal{O}(h^2 d^{1/2})$
  in dimension $d>0$ with stepsize $h>0$, despite only using one minibatch per iteration,
  thus providing excellent control of the sampling bias as a function of the stepsize.
  We apply the algorithm to explore local modes of the posterior distribution of Bayesian
  neural networks (BNNs) and evaluate the calibration performance of the posterior
  predictive probabilities for neural networks with convolutional neural network architectures
  for classification problems on three different datasets (Fashion-MNIST, Celeb-A
  and chest X-ray). Our results indicate that BNNs sampled with SMS-UBU can offer
  significantly better calibration performance compared to standard methods of training
  and stochastic weight averaging.
