abstract: " We develop a multivariate posterior sampling procedure through deep generative
  quantile learning. Simulation proceeds implicitly through a push-forward mapping
  that can transform i.i.d. random vectors samples from the posterior. We utilize
  Monge-Kantorovich depth in multivariate quantiles to directly sample from Bayesian
  credible sets, a unique feature not offered by typical posterior sampling methods.
  To enhance training of the quantile mapping, we design a neural network that automatically
  performs summary statistic extraction. This additional neural network structure
  has performance benefits including  support shrinkage (i.e. contraction of our posterior
  approximation) as the observation sample size increases. We demonstrate the usefulness
  of our approach on several examples where the absence of likelihood renders classical
  MCMC infeasible. Finally, we provide the following frequentist theoretical justifications
  for our quantile learning framework: consistency of the estimated vector quantile,
  of the recovered posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible
  sets. "
