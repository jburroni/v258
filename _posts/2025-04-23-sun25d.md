title: Spectral Representation for Causal Estimation with Hidden Confounders
software: https://github.com/haotiansun14/SpecIV
openreview: JHO7gsekNl
abstract: 'We study the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of unobserved
  confounders, focusing on two settings: instrumental variable (IV) regression with
  additional observed confounders, and proxy causal learning. Our approach uses a
  singular value decomposition of a conditional expectation operator combined with
  a saddle-point optimization method. In the IV regression setting, this can be viewed
  as a neural network generalization of the seminal approach due to Darolles et al.
  (2011). Saddle-point formulations have recently gained attention because they mitigate
  the double-sampling bias and are compatible with modern function approximation methods.
  We provide experimental validation across various settings and show that our approach
  outperforms existing methods on common benchmarks.'
