title: Reliable and Scalable Variable Importance Estimation via Warm-start and Early
  Stopping

abstract: As opaque black-box predictive models such as neural networks become more
  prevalent, the need to develop interpretations for these models is of great interest.
  The concept of $\textit{variable importance}$ is an interpretability measure that
  applies to any predictive model and assesses how much a variable or set of variables
  improves prediction performance. When the number of variables is large, estimating
  variable importance presents a significant challenge because re-training neural
  networks or other black-box algorithms requires significant additional computation.
  In this paper, we address this challenge for algorithms using gradient descent and
  gradient boosting (e.g. neural networks, gradient-boosted decision trees). By using
  the ideas of early stopping of gradient-based methods in combination with warm-start
  using the $\textit{dropout}$ method, we develop a scalable method to estimate variable
  importance for any algorithm that can be expressed as an $\textit{iterative kernel
  update equation}$.  Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees by using the  theory
  for early stopping of kernel-based methods for  neural networks with sufficient
  large width and gradient-boosting decision trees that use symmetric tree as a weaker
  learner. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through simulations and
  a real data example which illustrates the computational benefit of early stopping
  rather than fully re-training the model as well as the increased accuracy of taking
  initial steps from the dropout solution.
