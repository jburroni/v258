title: Models That Are Interpretable But Not Transparent
software: https://github.com/chudizhong/FaithfulDefense
openreview: 5wilN4aCW1
abstract: 'Faithful explanations are essential for machine learning models in high-stakes
  applications. Inherently interpretable models are well-suited for these applications
  because they naturally provide faithful explanations by revealing their decision
  logic. However, model designers often need to keep these models proprietary to maintain
  their value. This creates a tension: we need models that are interpretable—allowing
  human decision-makers to understand and justify predictions, but not transparent,
  so that the model’s decision boundary is not easily replicated by attackers. Shielding
  the model’s decision boundary is particularly challenging alongside the requirement
  of completely faithful explanations, since such explanations reveal the true logic
  of the model for an entire subspace around each query point. This work provides
  an approach, FaithfulDefense, that creates model explanations for logical models
  that are completely faithful, yet reveal as little as possible about the decision
  boundary. FaithfulDefense is based on a maximum set cover formulation, and we provide
  multiple formulations for it, taking advantage of submodularity.'
