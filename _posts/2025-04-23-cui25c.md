  AMP Threshold

abstract: Recently, Approximate Message Passing (AMP) has been integrated with stochastic
  localization (diffusion model) by providing a computationally efficient estimator
  of the posterior mean. Existing (rigorous) analysis typically proves the success
  of sampling for sufficiently small noise, but determining the exact threshold involves
  several challenges. In this paper, we focus on sampling from the posterior in the
  linear inverse problem, with an i.i.d. random design matrix, and show that the threshold
  for sampling coincide with that of posterior mean estimation. We give a proof for
  the convergence in smoothed KL divergence whenever the noise variance $\Delta$ is
  below $\Delta_{\rm AMP}$, which is the computation threshold for mean estimation
  introduced in (Barbier et al., 2020). We also show convergence in the Wasserstein
  distance under the same threshold assuming a dimension-free bound on the operator
  norm of the posterior covariance matrix, a condition strongly suggested by recent
  breakthroughs on operator norm bounds in similar replica symmetric systems. A key
  observation in our analysis is that phase transition does not occur along the sampling
  and interpolation paths assuming $\Delta<\Delta_{\rm AMP}$.
