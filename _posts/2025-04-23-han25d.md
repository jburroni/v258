title: A Differential Inclusion Approach for Learning Heterogeneous Sparsity in Neuroimaging
  Analysis
openreview: 7yTQehHDYa
abstract: In voxel-based neuroimaging disease prediction, it was recently found that
  in addition to lesion features, there exists another type of feature called "Procedural
  Bias", which is introduced during preprocessing and can further improve the prediction
  power. However, traditional sparse learning methods fail to simultaneously capture
  both types of features due to their heterogeneity in sparsity types. Specifically,
  the lesion features are spatially coherent and suffer from volumetric degeneration,
  while the procedural bias refers to enlarged voxels that are dispersedly distributed.
  In this paper, we propose a new method based on differential inclusion, which generates
  a sparse regularized solution path on multiple parameters that are enforced with
  heterogeneous sparsity to capture lesion features and the procedural bias separately.
  Specifically, we employ Total Variation with a non-negative constraint for the parameter
  associated with degenerated and spatially coherent lesions; on the other hand, we
  impose $\ell_1$ sparsity with a non-positive constraint on the parameter related
  to enlarged and scatterly distributed procedural bias. We theoretically show that
  our method enjoys model selection consistency and $\ell_2$ consistency in estimation.
  The utility of our method is demonstrated by improved prediction power and interpretability
  in the early prediction of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.
