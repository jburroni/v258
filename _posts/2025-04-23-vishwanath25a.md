abstract: " We consider the problem of recovering latent information from graphs under
  $\\varepsilon$-edge local differential privacy where the presence of relationships/edges
  between two users/vertices remains confidential, even from the data curator. For
  the class of generalized random dot-product graphs, we show that a standard local
  differential privacy mechanism induces a specific geometric distortion in the latent
  positions. Leveraging this insight, we show that consistent recovery of the latent
  positions is achievable by appropriately adjusting the statistical inference procedure
  for the privatized graph. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal
  under local edge differential privacy constraints. Lastly, we show that this framework
  allows for consistent recovery of geometric and topological information underlying
  the latent positions, as encoded in their persistence diagrams. Our results extend
  previous work from the private community detection literature to a substantially
  richer class of models and inferential tasks. "
