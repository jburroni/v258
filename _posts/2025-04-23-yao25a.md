title: Causal discovery in mixed additive noise models
software: https://github.com/STAN-UAntwerp/MERIT
openreview: 1YNxc4j8sd
abstract: Uncovering causal relationships in datasets that include both categorical
  and continuous variables is a challenging problem. The overwhelming majority of
  existing methods restrict their application to dealing with a single type of variable.
  Our contribution is a structural causal model designed to handle mixed-type data
  through a general function class. We present a theoretical foundation that specifies
  the conditions under which the directed acyclic graph underlying the causal model
  can be identified from observed data. In addition, we propose Mixed-type data Extension
  for Regression and Independence Testing (MERIT), enabling the discovery of causal
  connections in real-world classification settings. Our empirical studies demonstrate
  that MERIT outperforms its state-of-the-art competitor in causal discovery on relatively
  low-dimensional data.
