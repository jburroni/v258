abstract: " In this paper, we propose a novel model called Recurrent Explicit Duration
  Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (REDSLDS) that incorporates recurrent explicit
  duration variables into the rSLDS model. We also propose an inference and learning
  scheme that involves the use of P{ó}lya-gamma augmentation. We demonstrate the improved
  segmentation capabilities of our model on three benchmark datasets, including two
  quantitative datasets and one qualitative dataset. "
