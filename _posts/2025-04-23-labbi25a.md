title: 'Federated UCBVI: Communication-Efficient Federated Regret Minimization with
  Heterogeneous Agents'
software: https://github.com/Labbi-Safwan/Fed-UCBVI
openreview: j3Aa0YAmBE
abstract: In this paper, we present the Federated Upper Confidence Bound Value Iteration
  algorithm ($\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$), a novel extension of the $\texttt{UCBVI}$ algorithm
  (Azar et al., 2017) tailored for the federated learning framework. We prove that
  the regret of $\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$ scales as $\tilde O(\sqrt{H^3 |S| |A| T / M})$,
  with a small additional term due to heterogeneity, where $|S|$ is the number of
  states, $|A|$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode length,  $M$ is the number
  of agents, and $T$ is the number of episodes. Notably, in the single-agent setting,
  this upper bound matches the minimax lower bound up to polylogarithmic factors,
  while in the multi-agent scenario, $\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$ has linear speed-up. To
  conduct our analysis, we introduce a new measure of heterogeneity, which may hold
  independent theoretical interest. Furthermore, we show that, unlike existing federated
  reinforcement learning approaches,  $\texttt{Fed-UCBVI}$â€™s communication complexity
  only marginally increases with the number of agents.
