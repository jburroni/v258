title: Paths and Ambient Spaces in Neural Loss Landscapes
software: https://github.com/doldd/Paths-and-Ambient-Spaces
openreview: bwrd3y84te
abstract: Understanding the structure of neural network loss surfaces, particularly
  the emergence of low-loss tunnels, is critical for advancing neural network theory
  and practice. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to directly embed loss
  tunnels into the loss landscape of neural networks. Exploring the properties of
  these loss tunnels offers new insights into their length and structure and sheds
  light on some common misconceptions. We then apply our approach to Bayesian neural
  networks, where we improve subspace inference by identifying pitfalls and proposing
  a more natural prior that better guides the sampling procedure.
