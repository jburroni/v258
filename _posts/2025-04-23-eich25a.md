title: Entropic Matching for Expectation Propagation of Markov Jump Processes
software: https://github.com/yannickeich/ep4crns
openreview: 23yqeRmadg
abstract: We propose a novel, tractable latent state inference scheme for Markov jump
  processes, for which exact inference is often intractable. Our approach is based
  on an entropic matching framework that can be embedded into the well-known expectation
  propagation algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by providing
  closed-form results for a simple family of approximate distributions and apply it
  to the general class of chemical reaction networks, which are a crucial tool for
  modeling in systems biology. Moreover, we derive closed-form expressions for point
  estimation of the underlying parameters using an approximate expectation maximization
  procedure.  We evaluate our method across various chemical reaction networks and
  compare it to multiple baseline approaches, demonstrating superior performance in
  approximating the mean of the posterior process. Finally, we discuss the limitations
  of our method and potential avenues for future improvement, highlighting its promising
  direction for addressing complex continuous-time Bayesian inference problems.
