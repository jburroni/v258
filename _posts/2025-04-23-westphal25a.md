abstract: " In this paper, we introduce Partial Information Decomposition of Features
  (PIDF), a new paradigm for simultaneous data interpretability and feature selection.
  Contrary to traditional methods that assign a single importance value, our approach
  is based on three metrics per feature: the mutual information shared with the target
  variable, the featureâ€™s contribution to synergistic information, and the amount
  of this information that is redundant. In particular, we develop a novel procedure
  based on these three metrics, which reveals not only how features are correlated
  with the target but also the additional and overlapping information provided by
  considering them in combination with other features. We extensively evaluate PIDF
  using both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its potential applications
  and effectiveness, by considering case studies from genetics and neuroscience. "
