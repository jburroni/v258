title: Balls-and-Bins Sampling for DP-SGD
software: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/dpsgd_batch_sampler_accounting
openreview: RwJTeddgRD
abstract: We introduce the \emph{Balls-and-Bins} sampling for differentially private
  (DP) optimization methods such as DP-SGD. While it has been common practice to use
  some form of shuffling in DP-SGD implementations, privacy accounting algorithms
  have typically assumed that Poisson subsampling is used instead. Recent work by
  Chua et al. (2024), however, pointed out that shuffling based DP-SGD can have a
  much larger privacy cost in practical regimes of parameters. In this work we show
  that the Balls-and-Bins sampling achieves the "best-of-both" samplers, namely, the
  implementation of Balls-and-Bins sampling is similar to that of Shuffling and models
  trained using DP-SGD with Balls-and-Bins sampling achieve utility comparable to
  those trained using DP-SGD with Shuffling at the same noise multiplier, and yet,
  Balls-and-Bins sampling enjoys similar-or-better privacy amplification as compared
  to Poisson subsampling in practical regimes.
