abstract: " This work addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity and communication
  constraints in decentralized federated learning (FL). We introduce decentralized
  personalized FL (DPFL), a bi-level optimization framework that enhances personalized
  FL by leveraging combinatorial relationships among clients, enabling fine-grained
  and targeted collaborations. By employing a constrained greedy algorithm, DPFL constructs
  a collaboration graph that guides clients in choosing suitable collaborators, enabling
  personalized model training tailored to local data while respecting a fixed and
  predefined communication and resource budget. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates
  that the proposed objective for constructing the collaboration graph yields superior
  or equivalent performance compared to any alternative collaboration structures,
  including pure local training. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show
  that DPFL consistently outperforms existing methods, effectively handling non-IID
  data, reducing communication overhead, and improving resource efficiency in real-world
  decentralized FL scenarios. The code can be accessed at: \\url{https://github.com/salmakh1/DPFL.} "
