title: Sparse Activations as Conformal Predictors
software: https://github.com/deep-spin/sparse-activations-cp
openreview: Vu4qgEI7kC
abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification
  that replaces point predictions with sets, offering marginal coverage guarantees
  (i.e., ensuring that the sets contain the true label with a specified probability,
  in expectation).  In this paper, we uncover a novel connection between conformal
  prediction and sparse "softmax-like" transformations, such as sparsemax and $\gamma$-entmax
  (with $\gamma> 1$), which assign nonzero probability only to some labels.  We introduce
  new non-conformity scores for classification that make the calibration process correspond
  to the widely used temperature scaling method. At test time, applying these sparse
  transformations with the calibrated temperature leads to a support set (i.e., the
  set of labels with nonzero probability) that automatically inherits the coverage
  guarantees of conformal prediction.  Through experiments on computer vision and
  text classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
  competitive results in terms of coverage, efficiency, and adaptiveness compared
  to standard non-conformity scores based on softmax.
