abstract: " In the evolving landscape of machine learning, a pivotal challenge lies
  in deciphering the internal representations harnessed by neural networks and Transformers.
  Building on recent progress toward comprehending how networks execute distinct target
  functions, our study embarks on an exploration of the underlying reasons behind
  networks adopting specific computational strategies. We direct our focus to the
  complex algebraic learning task of modular addition involving $k$ inputs. Our research
  presents a thorough analytical characterization of the features learned by stylized
  one-hidden layer neural networks and one-layer Transformers in addressing this task.
  A cornerstone of our theoretical framework is the elucidation of how the principle
  of margin maximization shapes the features adopted by one-hidden layer neural networks.
  Let $p$ denote the modulus, $D_p$ denote the dataset of modular arithmetic with
  $k$ inputs and $m$ denote the network width. We demonstrate that a neuron count
  of $ m \\geq 2^{2k-2} \\cdot (p-1) $, these networks attain a maximum $ L_{2,k+1}
  $-margin on the dataset $ D_p $. Furthermore, we establish that each hidden-layer
  neuron aligns with a specific Fourier spectrum, integral to solving modular addition
  problems. By correlating our findings with the empirical observations of similar
  studies, we contribute to a deeper comprehension of the intrinsic computational
  mechanisms of neural networks. Furthermore, we observe similar computational mechanisms
  in attention matrices of one-layer Transformers. Our work stands as a significant
  stride in unraveling their operation complexities, particularly in the realm of
  complex algebraic tasks. "
