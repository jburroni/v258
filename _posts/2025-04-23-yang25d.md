title: Behavior-Inspired Neural Networks for Relational Inference

openreview: FBgjx0Ix2U
abstract: From pedestrians to Kuramoto oscillators, interactions between agents govern
  how dynamical systems evolve in space and time. Discovering how these agents relate
  to each other has the potential to improve our understanding of the often complex
  dynamics that underlie these systems. Recent works learn to categorize relationships
  between agents based on observations of their physical behavior. These approaches
  model relationship categories as outcomes of a categorical distribution which is
  limiting and contrary to real-world systems, where relationship categories often
  intermingle and interact. In this work, we introduce a level of abstraction between
  the observable behavior of agents and the latent categories that determine their
  behavior. To do this, we learn a mapping from agent observations to agent preferences
  for a set of latent categories. The learned preferences and inter-agent proximity
  are integrated in a nonlinear opinion dynamics model, which allows us to naturally
  identify mutually exclusive categories, predict an agent’s evolution in time, and
  control an agent’s behavior. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the utility
  of our model for learning interpretable categories, and the efficacy of our model
  for long-horizon trajectory prediction.
