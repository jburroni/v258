title: Order-Optimal Regret with Novel Policy Gradient Approaches in Infinite-Horizon
  Average Reward MDPs
openreview: ZJwMfQ6W9P
abstract: We present two Policy Gradient-based algorithms with general parametrization
  in the context of infinite-horizon average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP).
  The first one employs Implicit Gradient Transport for variance reduction, ensuring
  an expected regret of the order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$. The second approach,
  rooted in Hessian-based techniques, ensures an expected regret of the order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$.
  These results significantly improve the state-of-the-art $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$
  regret and achieve the theoretical lower bound. We also show that the average-reward
  function is approximately $L$-smooth, a result that was previously assumed in earlier
  works.
