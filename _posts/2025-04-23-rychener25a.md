title: Global Group Fairness in Federated Learning via Function Tracking
software: https://github.com/yvesrychener/Fair-FL
openreview: cAhy0bwMgd
abstract: We investigate group fairness regularizers in federated learning, aiming
  to train a globally fair model in a distributed setting. Ensuring global fairness
  in distributed training presents unique challenges, as fairness regularizers typically
  involve probability metrics between distributions across all clients and are not
  naturally separable by client. To address this, we introduce a function-tracking
  scheme for the global fairness regularizer based on a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD),
  which incurs a small communication overhead. This scheme seamlessly integrates into
  most federated learning algorithms while preserving rigorous convergence guarantees,
  as demonstrated in the context of FedAvg. Additionally, when enforcing differential
  privacy, the kernel-based MMD regularization enables straightforward analysis through
  a change of kernel, leveraging an intuitive interpretation of kernel convolution.
  Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical insights.
