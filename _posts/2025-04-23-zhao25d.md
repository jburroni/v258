abstract: " With the strengths of both deep learning and kernel methods like Gaussian
  Processes (GPs), Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) has gained considerable attention in
  recent years. From the computational perspective, however, DKL becomes challenging
  when the input dimension of the GP layer is high. To address this challenge, we
  propose the Deep Additive Kernel (DAK) model, which incorporates i) an additive
  structure for the last-layer GP; and ii) induced prior approximation for each GP
  unit. This naturally leads to a last-layer Bayesian neural network (BNN) architecture.
  The proposed method enjoys the interpretability of DKL as well as the computational
  advantages of BNN. Empirical results show that the proposed approach outperforms
  state-of-the-art DKL methods in both regression and classification tasks. "
