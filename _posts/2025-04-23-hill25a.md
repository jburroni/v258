title: Axiomatic Explainer Globalness via Optimal Transport
software: https://github.com/davinhill/WassersteinGlobalness
openreview: ftE0BWlWoY
abstract: Explainability methods are often challenging to evaluate and compare. With
  a multitude of explainers available, practitioners must often compare and select
  explainers based on quantitative evaluation metrics. One particular differentiator
  between explainers is the diversity of explanations for a given dataset; i.e. whether
  all explanations are identical, unique and uniformly distributed, or somewhere between
  these two extremes. In this work, we define a complexity measure for explainers,
  globalness, which enables deeper understanding of the distribution of explanations
  produced by feature attribution and feature selection methods for a given dataset.
  We establish the axiomatic properties that any such measure should possess and prove
  that our proposed measure, Wasserstein Globalness, meets these criteria. We validate
  the utility of Wasserstein Globalness using image, tabular, and synthetic datasets,
  empirically showing that it both facilitates meaningful comparison between explainers
  and improves the selection process for explainability methods.
