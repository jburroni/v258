title: Time-series attribution maps with regularized contrastive learning
software: https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA
openreview: aGrCXoTB4P
abstract: Gradient-based attribution methods aim to explain decisions of deep learning
  models but so far lack identifiability guarantees. Here, we propose a method to
  generate attribution maps with identifiability guarantees by developing a regularized
  contrastive learning algorithm trained on time-series data plus a new attribution
  method called Inverted Neuron Gradient (collectively named xCEBRA). We show theoretically
  that xCEBRA has favorable properties for identifying the Jacobian matrix of the
  data generating process. Empirically, we demonstrate robust approximation of zero
  vs. non-zero entries in the ground-truth attribution map on synthetic datasets,
  and significant improvements across previous attribution methods based on feature
  ablation, Shapley values, and other gradient-based methods. Our work constitutes
  a first example of identifiable inference of time-series attribution maps and opens
  avenues to a better understanding of time-series data, such as for neural dynamics
  and decision-processes within neural networks.
