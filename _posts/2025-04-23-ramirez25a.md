software: https://github.com/juan43ramirez/feasible-learning/
openreview: Y1BEQEELxI
abstract: We introduce Feasible Learning (FL), a sample-centric learning paradigm
  where models are trained by solving a feasibility problem that bounds the loss for
  each training sample. In contrast to the ubiquitous Empirical Risk Minimization
  (ERM) framework, which optimizes for average performance, FL demands satisfactory
  performance \emph{on every individual data point}. Since any model that meets the
  prescribed performance threshold is a valid FL solution, the choice of optimization
  algorithm and its dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the properties of the
  resulting solutions.  In particular, we study a primal-dual approach which dynamically
  re-weights the importance of each sample during training. To address the challenge
  of setting a meaningful threshold in practice, we introduce a relaxation of FL that
  incorporates slack variables of minimal norm. Our empirical analysis, spanning image
  classification, age regression, and preference optimization in large language models,
  demonstrates that models trained via FL can learn from data while displaying improved
  tail behavior compared to ERM, with only a marginal impact on average performance.
