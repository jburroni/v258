title: Restructuring Tractable Probabilistic Circuits
openreview: t1HteHSSfe
abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a unifying representation for probabilistic
  models that support tractable inference. Numerous applications of PCs like controllable
  text generation depend on the ability to efficiently multiply two circuits. Existing
  multiplication algorithms require that the circuits respect the same structure,
  i.e. variable scopes decomposes according to the same vtree. In this work, we propose
  and study the task of restructuring structured(-decomposable) PCs, that is, transforming
  a structured PC such that it conforms to a target vtree. We propose a generic approach
  for this problem and show that it leads to novel polynomial-time algorithms for
  multiplying circuits respecting different vtrees, as well as a practical depth-reduction
  algorithm that preserves structured decomposibility. Our work opens up new avenues
  for tractable PC inference, suggesting the possibility of training with less restrictive
  PC structures while enabling efficient inference by changing their structures at
  inference time.
