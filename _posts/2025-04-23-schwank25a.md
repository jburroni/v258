title: Robust Score Matching
software: https://gitlab.lrz.de/robust_score_matching/reproducibility
openreview: FFZ60lEExR
abstract: Proposed in Hyv{Ã¤}rinen (2005), score matching is a statistical estimation
  procedure that does not require computation of distributional normalizing constants.
  In this work we utilize the geometric median of means to develop a robust score
  matching procedure that yields consistent parameter estimates in settings where
  the observed data has been contaminated. A special appeal of the proposed method
  is that it retains convexity in exponential family models. The new method is therefore
  particularly attractive for non-Gaussian, exponential family graphical models where
  evaluation of normalizing constants is intractable. Support recovery guarantees
  for such models when contamination is present are provided. Additionally, support
  recovery is studied in numerical experiments and on a precipitation dataset. We
  demonstrate that the proposed robust score matching estimator performs comparably
  to the standard score matching estimator when no contamination is present but greatly
  outperforms this estimator in a setting with contamination.
