abstract: " We develop a new class of self-tuning algorithms to solve a root-finding
  problem involving a Lipschitz continuous operator, with applications in convex optimization,
  minimax saddle point problems and variational inequalities. Our methods are adaptive
  to the unknown, problem specific parameters, such as the Lipschitz constant and
  the variance of the stochastic operator. Unlike prior work, our approach does not
  rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a bounded domain, boundedness of the operator
  or a light-tailed distribution. We prove a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N^{-1/2})$ average-iterate
  convergence rate of the restricted merit function under an affine noise assumption,
  matching the optimal rate up to log factors. In addition, we improve the convergence
  rate to $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1})$ under a strong growth condition, characterizing the
  field of cutting-edge machine learning models and matching the optimal rate for
  the \\textit{deterministic regime}. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of
  the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments on saddle point problems.
  Our results suggest that the adaptive step sizes automatically take advantage of
  the structure of the noise and observe improved convergence in certain settings,
  such as when the strong growth condition holds. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first method  for root-finding problems under mild assumptions that adapts
  to the structure of the noise to obtain an improved convergence rate. "
