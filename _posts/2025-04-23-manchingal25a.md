abstract: " Predictions of uncertainty-aware models are diverse, ranging from single
  point estimates (often averaged over prediction samples) to predictive distributions,
  to set-valued or credal-set representations. We propose a novel unified evaluation
  framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers, applicable to a wide range of model
  classes, which allows users to tailor the trade-off between accuracy and precision
  of predictions via a suitably designed performance metric. This makes possible the
  selection of the most suitable model for a particular real-world application as
  a function of the desired trade-off. Our experiments, concerning Bayesian, ensemble,
  evidential, deterministic, credal and belief function classifiers on the CIFAR-10,
  MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets, show that the metric behaves as desired. "
