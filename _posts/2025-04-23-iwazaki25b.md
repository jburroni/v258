title: " No-Regret Bayesian Optimization with Stochastic Observation Failures "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=IEHddwHTIx "
abstract: " We study Bayesian optimization problems where observation of the objective
  function fails stochastically, e.g., synthesis failures in materials development.
  For this problem, although several heuristic methods have been proposed, they do
  not have theoretical guarantees and sometimes deteriorate in practice. We propose
  two algorithms that have a trade-off relation between regret bounds and practical
  performance. The first one is the first no-regret algorithm for this problem. The
  second one shows superior practical performance; however, we need some modification
  of the algorithm to obtain a no-regret guarantee, which is slightly worse than the
  first one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in numerical experiments,
  including the simulation function motivated by quasi-crystal synthesis. "
