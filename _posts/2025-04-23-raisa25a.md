title: A Bias-Variance Decomposition for Ensembles over Multiple Synthetic Datasets
software: https://github.com/DPBayes/generative-ensemble-bias-variance-decomposition
openreview: nIF8XvtIr7
abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the benefits of generating multiple synthetic
  datasets for supervised learning, from increased accuracy to more effective model
  selection and uncertainty estimation. These benefits have clear empirical support,
  but the theoretical understanding of them is currently very light. We seek to increase
  the theoretical understanding by deriving bias-variance decompositions for several
  settings of using multiple synthetic datasets, including differentially private
  synthetic data. Our theory yields a simple rule of thumb to select the appropriate
  number of synthetic datasets in the case of mean-squared error and Brier score.
  We investigate how our theory works in practice with several real datasets, downstream
  predictors and error metrics. As our theory predicts, multiple synthetic datasets
  often improve accuracy, while a single large synthetic dataset gives at best minimal
  improvement, showing that our insights are practically relevant.
