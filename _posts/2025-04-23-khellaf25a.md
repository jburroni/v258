abstract: " We study Federated Causal Inference, an approach to estimate treatment
  effects from decentralized data across centers. We compare three classes of Average
  Treatment Effect (ATE) estimators derived from the Plug-in G-Formula, ranging from
  simple meta-analysis to one-shot and multi-shot federated learning, the latter leveraging
  the full data to learn the outcome model (albeit requiring more communication).
  Focusing on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), we derive the asymptotic variance
  of these estimators for linear models. Our results provide practical guidance on
  selecting the appropriate estimator for various scenarios, including heterogeneity
  in sample sizes, covariate distributions, treatment assignment schemes, and center
  effects. We validate these findings with a simulation study. "
