abstract: " Concept erasure is the task of erasing information about a concept (e.g.,
  gender or race) from a representation set while retaining the maximum possible utility
  – information from original representations. Concept erasure is useful in several
  applications, such as removing sensitive concepts to achieve fairness and interpreting
  the impact of specific concepts on a model’s performance. Previous concept erasure
  techniques have prioritized robustly erasing concepts over retaining the utility
  of the resultant representations. However, there seems to be an inherent tradeoff
  between erasure and retaining utility, making it unclear how to achieve perfect
  concept erasure while maintaining high utility. In this paper, we offer a fresh
  perspective toward solving this problem by quantifying the fundamental limits of
  concept erasure through an information-theoretic lens. Using these results, we investigate
  constraints on the data distribution and the erasure functions required to achieve
  the limits of perfect concept erasure. Empirically, we show that the derived erasure
  functions achieve the optimal theoretical bounds. Additionally, we show that our
  approach outperforms existing methods on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets
  using GPT-4 representations. "
