abstract: " Multi-armed Bandit motivates methods with provable upper bounds on regret
  and also the counterpart lower bounds have been extensively studied in this context.
  Recently, Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandit has gained significant traction in various
  domains, where individual clients face bandit problems in a distributed manner and
  the objective is the overall system performance, typically measured by regret. While
  efficient algorithms with regret upper bounds have emerged, limited attention has
  been given to the corresponding regret lower bounds, except for a recent lower bound
  for adversarial settings, which, however, has a gap with let known upper bounds.
  To this end, we herein provide the first comprehensive study on regret lower bounds
  across different settings and establish their tightness. Specifically, when the
  graphs exhibit good connectivity properties and the rewards are stochastically distributed,
  we demonstrate a lower bound of order $O(\\log T)$ for instance-dependent bounds
  and $\\sqrt{T}$ for mean-gap independent bounds which are tight. Assuming adversarial
  rewards, we establish a lower bound $O(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ for connected graphs,
  thereby bridging the gap between the lower and upper bound in the prior work. We
  also show a linear regret lower bound when the graph is disconnected. These lower
  bounds are made possible through our newly constructed instances. In the numerical
  study, we assess the performance of various algorithms on these hard instances.
  While previous works have explored these settings with upper bounds, we provide
  a thorough study on tight lower bounds. "
