title: " Loss Gradient Gaussian Width based Generalization and Optimization Guarantees "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=3t33grIKkc "
abstract: " Generalization and optimization guarantees on the population loss often
  rely on uniform convergence based analysis, typically based on the Rademacher complexity
  of the predictors. The rich representation power of modern models has led to concerns
  about this approach. In this paper, we present generalization and optimization guarantees
  in terms of the complexity of the gradients, as measured by the Loss Gradient Gaussian
  Width (LGGW). First, we introduce generalization guarantees directly in terms of
  the LGGW under a flexible gradient domination condition. Second, we show that sample
  reuse in ERM does not make the empirical gradients deviate from the population gradients
  as long as the LGGW is small. Third, focusing on deep networks, we bound their single-sample
  LGGW in terms of the Gaussian width of the featurizer, i.e., the output of the last-but-one
  layer. To our knowledge, our generalization and optimization guarantees in terms
  of LGGW are the first results of its kind, and hold considerable promise towards
  quantitatively tight bounds for deep models. "
