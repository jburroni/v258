abstract: We investigate the problem of learning a Single Index Model (SIM)—a popular
  model for studying the ability of neural networks to learn features—from anisotropic
  Gaussian inputs by training a neuron using vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
  While the isotropic case has been extensively studied, the anisotropic case has
  received less attention and the impact of the covariance matrix on the learning
  dynamics remains unclear. For instance, Mousavi-Hosseini et al. (2023b) proposed
  a spherical SGD that requires a separate estimation of the data covariance matrix,
  thereby oversimplifying the influence of covariance. In this study, we analyze the
  learning dynamics of vanilla SGD under the SIM with anisotropic input data, demonstrating
  that vanilla SGD automatically adapts to the data’s covariance structure. Leveraging
  these results, we derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity using a
  notion of effective dimension that is determined by the structure of the covariance
  matrix instead of the input data dimension. Finally, we validate and extend our
  theoretical findings through numerical simulations, demonstrating the practical
  effectiveness of our approach in adapting to anisotropic data, which has implications
  for efficient training of neural networks.
