abstract: " In the era of foundation models, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problems, i.e.,
  the data discrepancy between the training environments and testing environments,
  hinder AI generalization. Further, relational data like graphs disobeying the Independent
  and Identically Distributed (IID) condition makes the problem more challenging,
  especially much harder when it is associated with time. Motivated by this, to realize
  the robust invariant learning over temporal graphs, we want to investigate what
  components in temporal graphs are most invariant and representative with respect
  to labels. With the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, we propose an error-bounded
  Invariant Link Selector that can distinguish invariant components and variant components
  during the training process to make the deep learning model generalizable for different
  testing scenarios. Besides deriving a series of rigorous generalizable optimization
  functions, we also equip the training with task-specific loss functions, e.g., temporal
  link prediction, to make pre-trained models solve real-world application tasks like
  citation recommendation and merchandise recommendation, as demonstrated in our experiments
  with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/kthrn22/OOD-Linker} "
