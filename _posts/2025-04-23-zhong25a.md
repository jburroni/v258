title: Bridging Domains with Approximately Shared Features

openreview: 25oDoZG4a5
abstract: 'Machine learning models can suffer from performance degradation when applied
  to new tasks due to distribution shifts. Feature representation learning offers
  a robust solution to this issue. However, a fundamental challenge remains in devising
  the optimal strategy for feature selection. Existing literature is somewhat paradoxical:
  some advocate for learning invariant features from source domains, while others
  favor more diverse features. For better understanding, we propose a statistical
  framework that evaluates the utilities of the features (i.e., how differently the
  features are used in each source task) based on the variance of their correlation
  to $y$ across different domains. Under our framework, we design and analyze a learning
  procedure consisting of learning content features (comprising both invariant and
  approximately shared features) from source tasks and fine-tuning them on the target
  task. Our theoretical analysis highlights the significance of learning approximately
  shared features—beyond strictly invariant ones—when distribution shifts occur. Our
  analysis also yields an improved population risk on target tasks compared to previous
  results. Inspired by our theory, we introduce ProjectionNet, a practical method
  to distinguish content features from environmental features via \textit{explicit
  feature space control}, further consolidating our theoretical findings.'
