title: " Tensor Network Based Feature Learning Model "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=Dttmp0TPVY "
abstract: " Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity
  of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets.
  One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping
  the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial
  and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features
  was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters.
  \ However, another important aspect of model training — identifying optimal feature
  hyperparameters — has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard
  cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL)
  model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable
  Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently
  learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model
  parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove
  the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality
  and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times
  faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated
  model. "
