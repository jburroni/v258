abstract: " Interpretable classification of time series poses significant challenges
  in high dimensions. Traditional feature selection methods in the frequency domain
  often assume sparsity in spectral matrices (or their inverses) which can be restrictive
  for real-world applications. We propose a model-based approach for classifying high-dimensional
  stationary time series by assuming sparsity in the difference between spectra. The
  estimators for the model parameters are proven to be consistent under general conditions.
  We also introduce a method to select the most discriminatory frequencies, and it
  possesses the sure screening property.  The novelty of our method lies in the interpretability
  of the parameters hence suitable for neuroscience where understanding differences
  in brain network connectivity across various states is crucial. The proposed approach
  is tested using several simulated examples and applied to EEG and calcium imaging
  datasets to demonstrate its practical relevance. "
