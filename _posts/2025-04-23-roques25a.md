title: Personalized Convolutional Dictionary Learning of Physiological Time Series
software: https://github.com/axelroques/PerCDL
openreview: s74HpEDH4a
abstract: 'Human physiological signals tend to exhibit both global and local structures:
  the former are shared across a population, while the latter reflect inter-individual
  variability.  For instance, kinetic measurements of the gait cycle during locomotion
  present common characteristics, although idiosyncrasies may be observed due to biomechanical
  disposition or pathology. To better represent datasets with local-global structure,
  this work extends Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL), a popular method for
  learning interpretable representations, or dictionaries, of time-series data. In
  particular, we propose Personalized CDL (PerCDL), in which a local dictionary models
  local information as a personalized spatiotemporal transformation of a global dictionary.
  The transformation is learnable and can combine operations such as time-warping
  and rotation. Formal computational and statistical guarantees for PerCDL are provided
  and its effectiveness on synthetic and real human locomotion data is demonstrated.'
