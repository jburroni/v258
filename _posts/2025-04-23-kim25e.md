title: " Robust Estimation in metric spaces: Achieving Exponential Concentration with
  a Fréchet Median "

abstract: " There is growing interest in developing statistical estimators that achieve
  exponential concentration around a population target even when the data distribution
  has heavier than exponential tails. More recent activity has focused on extending
  such ideas beyond Euclidean spaces to Hilbert spaces and Riemannian manifolds. In
  this work, we show that such exponential concentration in presence of heavy tails
  can be achieved over a broader class of parameter spaces called CAT($\\kappa$) spaces,
  a very general metric space equipped with the minimal essential geometric structure
  for our purpose, while being sufficiently broad to encompass most typical examples
  encountered in statistics and machine learning. The key technique is to develop
  and exploit a general concentration bound for the Fréchet median in CAT($\\kappa$)
  spaces. We illustrate our theory through a number of examples, and provide empirical
  support through simulation studies. "
