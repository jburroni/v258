title: Fast Convergence of Softmax Policy Mirror Ascent
software: https://github.com/reza-asad/SPMA
openreview: VCJ8NfVrcO
abstract: Natural policy gradient (NPG) is a common policy optimization algorithm
  and can be viewed as mirror ascent in the space of probabilities. Recently, Vaswani
  et al. (2021) introduced a policy gradient method that corresponds to mirror ascent
  in the dual space of logits. We refine this algorithm, removing its need for a normalization
  across actions and analyze the resulting method (referred to as SPMA). For tabular
  MDPs, we prove that SPMA with a constant step-size matches the linear convergence
  of NPG and achieves a faster convergence than constant step-size (accelerated) softmax
  policy gradient. To handle large state-action spaces, we extend SPMA to use a log-linear
  policy parameterization. Unlike that for NPG, generalizing SPMA to the linear function
  approximation (FA) setting does not require compatible function approximation. Unlike
  MDPO, a practical generalization of NPG, SPMA with linear FA only requires solving
  convex softmax classification problems. We prove that SPMA achieves linear convergence
  to the neighbourhood of the optimal value function. We extend SPMA to handle non-linear
  FA and evaluate its empirical performance on the MuJoCo and Atari benchmarks. Our
  results demonstrate that SPMA consistently achieves similar or better performance
  compared to MDPO, PPO and TRPO.
