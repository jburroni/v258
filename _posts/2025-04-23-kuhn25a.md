openreview: 3E9HooMHRV
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) provides a robust framework for comparing probability
  distributions. Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the
  underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined,
  e.g., as a Euclidean metric, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled
  data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet,
  predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying
  significance of different features in the data, and existing supervised ground metric
  learning methods often fail to generalize across multiple classes or are limited
  to distributions with shared supports.   To address this issue, this paper introduces
  a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared
  metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points (samples)
  like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for
  training. The resulting learned global ground metric enables more accurate OT distances,
  which can significantly improve clustering and classification tasks. Further, we
  can create task-specific shared embeddings for elements (samples) from different
  distributions, including unseen data.
