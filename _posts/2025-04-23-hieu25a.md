title: " Decoupling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties with possibility theory "
openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=n6hsIQJXSt "
abstract: " The special role of epistemic uncertainty in Machine Learning is now well
  recognised, and an increasing amount of research is focused on methods for dealing
  specifically with such a lack of knowledge. Yet, most often, a probabilistic representation
  is considered for both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, hence creating challenges
  in applications where decoupling these two types of uncertainty is necessary. In
  this work, we show that an alternative representation of epistemic uncertainty,
  based on possibility theory, maintains many of the convenient features of standard
  Bayesian inference while displaying specific behaviours and properties that closely
  match the ones of an intuitive notion of information. Our main contributions are:
  i) a general framework for jointly representing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties,
  ii) a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the analogue of Bayesâ€™ rule in possibility
  theory, iii) a version of the law of large numbers and of the central limit theorem
  for the associated variables, and iv) an analysis of the properties of the possibilistic
  maximum a posteriori. These results highlight that a dedicated and principled representation
  of epistemic uncertainty, that is compatible with standard Bayesian inference and
  preserves many of its strengths, is attainable. "
