title: Functional Stochastic Gradient MCMC for Bayesian Neural Networks
openreview: MSYG8XHh0U
abstract: Classical parameter-space Bayesian inference for Bayesian neural networks
  (BNNs) suffers from several unresolved prior issues, such as knowledge encoding
  intractability and pathological behaviours in deep networks, which can lead to improper
  posterior inference. To address these issues, functional Bayesian inference has
  recently been proposed leveraging functional priors, such as the emerging functional
  variational inference. In addition to variational methods, stochastic gradient Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is another scalable and effective inference method for
  BNNs to asymptotically generate samples from the true posterior by simulating continuous
  dynamics. However, existing MCMC methods perform solely in parameter space and inherit
  the unresolved prior issues, while extending these dynamics to function space is
  a non-trivial undertaking. In this paper, we introduce novel functional MCMC schemes,
  including stochastic gradient versions, based on newly designed diffusion dynamics
  that can incorporate more informative functional priors. Moreover, we prove that
  the stationary measure of these functional dynamics is the target posterior over
  functions. Our functional MCMC schemes demonstrate improved performance in both
  predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification on several tasks compared to
  naive parameter-space MCMC and functional variational inference.
