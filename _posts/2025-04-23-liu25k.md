title: Optimal Stochastic Trace Estimation in Generative Modeling
software: https://github.com/xinyangATK/GenHutch-plus-plus
openreview: tYVDkoymXT
abstract: Hutchinson estimators are widely employed in training divergence-based likelihoods
  for diffusion models to ensure optimal transport (OT) properties. However, this
  estimator often suffers from high variance and scalability concerns. To address
  these challenges, we investigate Hutch++, an optimal stochastic trace estimator
  for generative models, designed to minimize training variance while maintaining
  transport optimality. Hutch++ is particularly effective for handling ill-conditioned
  matrices with large condition numbers, which commonly arise when high-dimensional
  data exhibits a low-dimensional structure. To mitigate the need for frequent and
  costly QR decompositions, we propose practical schemes that balance frequency and
  accuracy, backed by theoretical guarantees. Our analysis demonstrates that Hutch++
  leads to generations of higher quality. Furthermore, this method exhibits effective
  variance reduction in various applications, including simulations, conditional time
  series forecasts, and image generation.
