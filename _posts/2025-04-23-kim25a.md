openreview: " https://openreview.net/forum?id=kYJSAg7Try "
abstract: " We present the Generative Flow Ant Colony Sampler (GFACS), a novel meta-heuristic
  method that hierarchically combines amortized inference and parallel stochastic
  search. Our method first leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to amortize
  a multi-modal prior distribution over combinatorial solution space that encompasses
  both high-reward and diversified solutions. This prior is iteratively updated via
  parallel stochastic search in the spirit of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), leading
  to the posterior distribution that generates near-optimal solutions. Extensive experiments
  across seven combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate GFACSâ€™s promising performances. "
