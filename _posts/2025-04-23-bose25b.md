title: 'Keeping up with dynamic attackers: Certifying robustness to adaptive online
  data poisoning'
software: https://github.com/Avinandan22/Certified-Robustness
openreview: iF4MLcnF2u
abstract: The rise of foundation models fine-tuned on human feedback from potentially
  untrusted users has increased the risk of adversarial data poisoning, necessitating
  the study of robustness of learning algorithms against such attacks. Existing research
  on provable certified robustness against data poisoning attacks primarily focuses
  on certifying robustness for static adversaries who modify a fraction of the dataset
  used to train the model before the training algorithm is applied. In practice, particularly
  when learning from human feedback in an online sense, adversaries can observe and
  react to the learning process and inject poisoned samples that optimize adversarial
  objectives better than when they are restricted to poisoning a static dataset once,
  before the learning algorithm is applied. Indeed, it has been shown in prior work
  that online dynamic adversaries can be significantly more powerful than static ones.
  We present a novel framework for computing certified bounds on the impact of dynamic
  poisoning, and use these certificates to design robust learning algorithms. We give
  an illustration of the framework for the mean estimation problem and binary classification
  problems and outline directions for extending this in further work.
