abstract: " In this paper we establish a new connection between Tensor Network (TN)-constrained
  kernel machines and Gaussian Processes (GPs). We prove that the outputs of Canonical
  Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) and Tensor Train (TT)-constrained kernel machines converge
  in the limit of large ranks to the same GP which we fully characterize, when specifying
  appropriate i.i.d. priors across their components. We show that TT-constrained models
  achieve faster convergence to the GP compared to their CPD counterparts for the
  same number of model parameters. The convergence to the GP occurs as the ranks tend
  to infinity, as opposed to the standard approach which introduces TNs as an additional
  constraint on the posterior. This implies that the newly established priors allow
  the models to learn features more freely as they necessitate infinitely more parameters
  to converge to a GP, which is characterized by a fixed learning representation and
  thus no feature learning. As a consequence, the newly derived priors yield more
  flexible models which can better fit the data, albeit at increased risk of overfitting.
  We demonstrate these considerations by means of two numerical experiments. "
